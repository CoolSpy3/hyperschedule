It is difficult to value art with no reasonable or robust track record in the secondary marketplace (i.e. at auction) nor with any historical pedigree. Yet the market for contemporary art works has far surpassed many other categories of collecting, including Impressionist and Modern art. This course looks at the dynamics at play in the contemporary art marketplace. Through a combination of case studies, as well as structural and statistical analysis, students will unpack the contemporary art market, while comparing it to markets for other goods (real estate, luxury goods, and commodities)."

We will learn how to combine these case studies to create a more complex, nuanced version(s) of environmental science and policy. Cross-country comparisons will allow us to deconstruct hegemonic narratives, while providing an ?international? environmental discourse. We will examine how environmental degradation is evaluated in different countries and how it affects environmental policy, as well as how policies reflect cultural heritage. We will compare how climate change will impact different parts of the world and evaluate how various countries have responded. We will determine how various countries value and protect biodiversity. By comparing Japan, the US, and other countries, we will learn how environmental science and policies vary based on culturally defined epistemologies. By doing this, we will appreciate the complexity of environmental issues and be better equipped to address global environmental issues, such as climate change and biodiversity losses.||``||"

Japan was a key player in transforming the East Asian region. As the economies of East Asia have become increasingly integrated, linkages between these societies have also become both deeper and broader. However, the region is also facing considerable challenges. Security issues are dominant, examples being the Korean peninsula, and territorial disputes. Environmental/ natural resource issues provide another set of key challenges. How do we understand these challenges and how do we assess Japan?s responses? This course will begin by outlining the prominent theories of international relations, which will then become the tools we use to analyze the important issues and challenges facing Japan in East Asia. We will pick up a number of prominent case studies from contemporary East Asia, and investigate from the perspective of Japan?s international relations.

Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

His film essay is an exorcism of the world, a melancholy, critical farewell-but Sans Soleil is also about the world, a visual celebration of that world: at once exorcism and homage; a leave-taking and a reverent, fine-grained representation. That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the "writing on the walls of the prison house of culture," a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a "matter of life and death." We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation.

One approach called "the anthropology of Islam," treats Islam as a "discursive tradition," grounding present and future practices in past textual authorities. This literature has been largely concerned with authority, governance, and public piety. However, this literature is now considered paradigmatic, if not dominant. In this course, we will read the anthropology of Islam with an eye towards what comes next?namely, bringing these important critiques into conversation with media studies, science and technology studies, migration studies, political economy, and queer theory."

This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, "scientific rationality" -- as we will call it for the moment -- is "located." What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compelling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps "at work" even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer thee questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic -- the elements of "scientific rationality." Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for "us" what is "irrational." Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that "do" science act, think, and make knowledge.

This seminar invites students to question received categories for classifying and understanding these forms of migration by examining them as types of intimate labor that fundamentally reshape constructions of family, citizenship, labor, gender and sexuality across borders. The framework of intimate labor requires one to rethink scholarly, policy and activist formulations of migration and the phenomenon of 'human trafficking' premised on artificial distinctions between forced and voluntary movement, formal and informal migration and labor and legitimate and illegitimate statuses in host and receiving countries. The course will look at readings in various transnational contexts to question ways in which intimate labor is being reconfigured through gendered migration practices and policies. The seminar will primarily look at these issues through an anthropological lens, but we will engage other disciplines such as economics, sociology and politics to enhance our understandings of convergences across modes of intimate labor and reduce gaps between policy and lived experience."

While biomedical knowledge is often based on the assumption of a universal "normal" human body, medical anthropologists study how interactions between people and their material, cultural, and political environments produce both social and biological differentiation. At the same time, an anthropological approach to biomedicine suggests that biomedical ideas and practices are always linked to political and economic interests and social values. This course examines the constitution and contestation of biomedical knowledge from a global perspective. Drawing on contemporary anthropological research, we will consider the specificity of biomedicine in relation to other forms of knowledge and belief about the body and its care. Course topics will include the global politics of biomedical research and clinical trials; diagnostic categories and pharmaceutical treatments; modes of evaluating, assessing, and quantifying health and illness; and postgenomic understandings of the self and society."

Through anthropological texts, students will study the challenges of inequality for the youngest members of diverse cultures from around the world. We will examine solutions that have been proposed for problems ranging from infant mortality to malnutrition and each student will invent something that might help children in some way."

Beginning with a familiar vantage point (say, the college campus), the course casts a wide net and asks, is what we call depression in the suburbs of Los Angeles fundamentally the same thing in Mumbai and in the rural areas of South Africa? What does the burgeoning number of children in the United States diagnosed with ADHD say about changes in American childhood and in the medical profession, in cultural understandings of the brain and of human behavior? How does the proliferating use of psychoactive drugs affect conceptions of the self and of well-being? This course examines, in short, the intersections of mental health with lived experience in a cross-cultural context, juxtaposing the writings of medical professionals with the narratives of those experiencing mental illness in the most varied circumstances from the residence halls in Claremont to the streets of Brazil. It introduces students to the idea that the science of mental health is itself a culturally informed and shifting terrain. Yet the course may also lead one to wonder whether certain manifestations of suffering and the desire for health are not also intrinsic to a shared human experience that transcends our moment in time and our most familiar surroundings."

The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists' inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.

We will begin with an overview of the use of visual material, film and photography in both anthropological fieldwork as well as popular documentary films of the early 20th century. While the formal and aesthetic language of documentary film is often taken to signal "reality" in popular understandings of the genre, how has this framing been challenged within visual anthropology? Students will learn about the changing relationship of anthropology to visual practices through a number of screenings, readings and lectures that explore issues of power and representation and the visual medium."

Using economic intuition we will be able to address issues ranging from outsourcing to new product lines. We will be able to explain why some firms actively compete through price changes and while others in apparently similar competitive industries do not. Economic theories seem very abstract to many students because these theories usually assume many unrealistic things about people and society. Students must be mindful of the fact that these assumptions are what allow economists to answer many otherwise intractable questions. The results that we attain usually hold even without these simplifying assumptions. This class will show how some of these economic models can provide a powerful, formal framework for answering managerial questions ranging from dealing with competition to setting proper incentives for managers."

The third world liberation front used nonviolent social protest to call for educational relevance and greater access to higher education.   With a critical analysis of oppression and imperialism, the 1968 Third World Strike led to the institutionalization of Ethnic Studies. As such, it is a natural extension that an Asian American Studies class examines the history, philosophy, and practice of nonviolent social change. Nonviolence is neither the absence of violence nor passively avoiding violence.  It is an active engagement with society in order to fight for justice and freedom for all humans. Mohandas Gandhi conceptualized nonviolence as soul-force or satyagraha to mobilize Indians to challenge British colonialism in the early 1900s. Cesar Chavez and Philip Vera Cruz deployed non-violent mobilization techniques with the United Farm Workers to bring together Chican@/Latin@ and Filipin@ agricultural workers to demand better labor conditions in the 1960s.  Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King, Jr., Thich Nhat Hanh approaches nonviolence as inter-being to organize social welfare and peace campaigns during the Vietnam War.

The readings are in a smaller quantity but are dense theoretically.  The purpose is for students to read them closely multiple times before class and to be able extrapolate from them in class. Please bring your reading to class in order to be able to refer to it during discussions.   Moreover, this class is based on a mutually respectful relationship with the community partners and a social justice model of community-based learning. ||``||"

We have fought hard for and have contributed immensely to the formation of civil rights jurisprudence in our great nation. In addition, the class will attempt to tie in current events and contemporary issues to the past. From this critical analysis, students should leave the class with a better understanding of the current state of the Asian Pacific American community, although each student may (and probably will) have a different opinion on how the community should address current issues and concerns. The goal of the class is to instill critical thinking and historical understanding, not to impose one perspective on the law and public policy.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over 'illegality' further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives."

Here, through close reading and discussion of battlefield harangues and Assembly deliberations, of despotic tyranny and democratic nudging, we will explore together the contours of these ancient Greek conversations as leadership evolved and eventually began to be theorized. Our seminar readings will include both modern scholarship and ancient sources, the latter drawn primarily from Homer's Iliad, from the historiographies of Herodotus and Thucydides, and from the writings of the fourth-century scholar-warrior Xenophon (including his Socratic Memorabilia, his campaign memoir Anabasis, and his Cyropaedia, an extended meditation on the ideal leader).

What can we know about how sexuality and gender shaped the lived realities of historical Romans? How were normative models of gender and sexuality constructed and enforced in the Roman world? Do we have evidence of counter-cultural activity or gender/sexuality-based subcultures? In order to develop our own answers to these questions, we will conduct a theoretically-informed exploration of the intersections between gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social class, and political status in the ancient Roman world. We will draw on literary and material evidence, including poetry, medical texts, architecture, and visual art. By utilizing feminist and anti-racist approaches and actively making thoughtful comparisons with our own lived experiences, students in this course will become a community of scholars engaged in a meaningful inquiry into gender and sexuality in Ancient Rome and today. <a href="https://romasexualis2020.wordpress.com"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>"

The emerging field of Computational Creativity explores the meaning and types of creativity as well as whether, and to what degree, computers can be said to be creative. Applicable fields include music, visual arts, literary arts, culinary arts, theatre arts, mathematics, and general problem solving.

We'll talk about how to programmatically leverage multicore processors, caching, GPUs, clusters, and SIMD operations. Student grades are based entirely on weekly homework assignments, which are divided into three parts: prescribed exercises, open-ended problems that ask the students to illustrate the current concept by coming up with an illustrative example and analyzing it, and finally short answer problems in which students explain the concept to a non-technical audience. The course will progressively cover single core, multi-core, GPU, and finally multi-processor programming. As a driving and recurring example, students will implement course topics in their own 1D finite difference wave equation solver, the background for which will be provided in class. All classwork will be done in C/C++, with a few examples in Python and some emergent programming languages for performative comparison."

Such common threads include concepts like: orishas (deities of the Yoruba West African tradition that represent varying archetypes and forces of nature), ashé (a multifaceted Yoruba word meaning sacred energy/life force present throughout the Afro-Latin diaspora), playful improvisation, polyrhythmic music, call and response as community-building, dance and music as social resistance, and the intrinsic relationship between the sacred and the profane. Students will learn about the complex origin of Latin dance practices and how many of them arose out of persecution, self-defense, and a deep desire to hold onto tradition and celebrate life in the face of great injustice."

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.||``||"
"DANC139  PO"||`||""||`||"DANC139  PO"||`||"Dance, Ethnicity, Nationalism"||`||"PTHD"||`||"PO"||`||"PO"||`||"In the United States, and generally in Western Europe, most individuals think of dance in three ways: 1.  A social activity such as a school dance or dancing in a club, 2. A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like "Dancing with the Stars," or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes."

Texts exemplifying feminist ethnographic methods in dance and performance studies explore intercontinental connections through media, geography, and collective aesthetic and political impulses. The ethnographies we read, focused on performance broadly construed, represent feminist research concerns and methodologies of women of color.  Additionally, through case studies we approach topics addressed by feminist artists in their work (blackness, passing, environmental concerns, sexual violence, lesbian identity, immigration, disability, among others). We will train in feminist theory and methods in critical performance ethnography, and engage in thoughtful performance making and criticism. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing.

GIS"||`||"PEVA"||`||"PO"||`||"PO"||`||"Maps have the power to reveal relationships that are not readily seen, such as uneven impacts of COVID-19, global climate change, environmental pollution, and so on. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions.  In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equity.

Early seminars introduce the chemical processes and 'signatures' of headwaters and gaining surface waters. The course is structured to focus on different types of systems separately, e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and estuaries while demonstrating that many of the same ecological processes and phenomena occur in each, i.e., biogeochemical cycling, controls on primary production, evolutionary selection, community patterns, population dynamics and food web structure. The most visible taxa in aquatic systems will be introduced including algae, plants, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles via laboratory and field work. The course will discuss how drinking, irrigation, recreation, transportation, flood control and power generation compete for water resources, altering the ecology of inlands ecosystems. Case studies will integrate ecological sub-disciplines while highlighting the human-nature conflicts in freshwater systems. Students interested in watershed and marine systems will find the course extremely useful in their understanding of how various biota co-exist in these seemingly simple systems.

For example, we will discover why genes form chromosomes, why people form nations, and why the reasons for the two are similar. The emphasis will be on a few key ideas that have broad and profound application. In our journey, we will learn from where social systems evolved and perhaps to where social systems may be evolving.

The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting).

After successfully completing this course, you will understand the drivers behind (traditional) corporate financial decision-making as well as the challenges associated with unlocking private capital for climate investments. We discuss most of the major financial decisions made by corporate executives both within the firm and in their interactions with investors. Essential in most of these decisions is the process of valuation, which will be emphasized throughout the course. Topics include investment criteria, valuation of financial assets and liabilities, relationships between risk and return, capital structure choice, payout policy, as well as valuation and capital budgeting for the levered firm. The latter is studied in detail as it provides a solid background for analyzing the firm's use of green financing options such as green bonds."

Recent work in behavioral economics uses experimental studies of how real people learn and behave to develop economic models of decision-making and performance. Behavioral game theory applies these techniques in settings with strategic interaction. Behavioral finance applies these techniques to decisions and performance in financial markets. The approach differs from the hyper-rational approach of standard new-classical theory by employing more realistic assumptions about how individuals acquire and use information about other individuals and the environment. The models have the potential to explain phenomena that neo-classical theory has difficulty explaining and provide more accurate predictions that can inform firm strategy and public policy. The course is aimed primarily at Ph.D. and M.A. students in Economics, but should also appeal to those from Politics and Policy or Management who have some previouse exposure to economics. The Course serves as a substitute for one of the core courses in the MAPEB program, such as M.A. level game theory or Managerial Economics."

Close reading begins, not with the question, "What do these words mean?" but instead, the question, "What do these words say?"  And then, "What if these words mean just what they say?"  And then, "What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).  "

Since a definition of racial identity is complicated and multifaceted, it is important to begin with an understanding that the African American poetic voice is not monolithic. In terms of a poetic tradition, however, one could argue that the history of social and political struggle (Abolitionism, Civil Rights, Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, LBGTQ rights, and Afrofuturism) established an artistic continuum. This tradition is shaped by intimacy, a desire for justice, joy, transcendence from suffering, and the simple and complicated wish to be free. We will discuss religion, visual culture, politics, dance, music, and comedy. Rather than reduce African American poetry to a timeline, we will follow the echoes of history, analyzing how voices and themes overlap."

This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one "body" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few)  across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of "affordance" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the "vivid" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception."

His film essay is an exorcism of the world, a bitter, critical farewellbut Sans Soleil is also about the world, a visually stunning celebration of that world: at once exorcism and homage; a leave-taking and a reverent, fine-grained representation. That is the tension inherent in the form of the essay, a global, politically and culturally rich non-fiction form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world, and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of thinking, writing, photographing, filming. Since its inception in the sixteenth century, the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the "writing on the walls of the prison-house of culture," a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a "matter of life and death." We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in both literature and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be working across disciplines and media, thinking about the relationship between representation, authority, aesthetics, and writing, photography, and film.  Assignments will be both written and visual; you will learn to film, edit, and write for your own video or film essay.

He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: "she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son's rhythm is different." A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called "How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces." At the heart of the course was Barthes' concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of "individual rhythms" that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes' notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: "spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living." How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we'll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to "content." Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M."

This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women's rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking."

The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form's origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States.

Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology 'the folklore of white supremacy.' Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, 'desirable things' that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler's words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a 'type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.' Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences.

Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality. No previous knowledge or experience expected."

Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting?

You will need to be self-reliant to succeed.||``||||``||Advanced manufacturing is the backbone of most industries and the productivity of anindustry or country depends significantly on the development and implementation of newtechnologies as one faces challenges globally. Much of the technical information on newtechnologies is available in the patent literature (U.S. Patents) (a resource hardly tapped) and some fundamental work in the technical literature. Magazine articles and the worldwide web (www) generally cover the overall features. Students in this course will have an opportunity to explore the latest advances in manufacturing processes first hand, which would otherwise take||``||years before it appears in textbooks. Where appropriate, industry experts will provide guest presentations and an on-site tour may be incorporated. No required textbook; only reference material.||``||||``||Topics covered in this course may include, purification of materials [electro-slag remelting (ESR), vacuum melting, zone refining, melting to remove tramp elements]; precision casting; densification of materials (conventional sintering, reaction sintering, hot-pressing, hot-isostatic pressing); directional solidification and growth of single crystals (Czochralski process and Bridgeman technique); mechanical alloying; liquid phase infiltration; net-shaped finishing; superplastic forming; processing of nanocrystalline materials (sol-gel processing); float glass or flat glass processing; tape laying; microwave processing; laser processing; ultraprecision machining (UPM) and ultraprecision grinding (UPG); polishing and lapping; engineered surfaces and surface modification [CVD and PVD (sputtering and ion plating) coatings including multilayer coatings]; and layer processing for electronic materials. These and other topics the students may choose are rarely exposed, if at all, and definitely not at the same depth, to typical engineering students. You will receive a list of some 20 case studies as examples and a one-||``||page description of each topic outlining the resources available, such as U. S. Patents or technical literature, as guidelines. You are free to choose any topic from this list or some other topic of interest. In most cases, students pick additional topics. ||``||||``||This is an open ended course where students receive the opportunity to select a topic of interest dealing with advanced processing, prepare a patent search, analyze patents, prepare a technical report, and present the results in a power point presentation (PPT) format to the entire class. This way, in addition to acquiring knowledge on various manufacturing processes and materials, students improve upon their analytical and communicational skills (both written and oral). Students have the option to form a team of two or work individually. During the span of the course,||``||-conduct three case studies. Each case study takes 4-5 weeks.||``||-Each week, make a PPT on the progress of your work and||``||-on the last week of each case study, make final presentations and submit technical reports.||``||||``||At the beginning of the course, the students were given a list of anticipated ABET program outcomes. Depending on the topic chosen by a particular student, the relevance of these outcomes vary. At the end of the semester, the students are given a questionnaire, which is essentially the same as the outcomes given at the beginning of the course. The only difference is after each outcome, two items were included, namely, students analysis before and after the course (in a scale of 1-10) for self-assessment.

We attend to strategies filmmakers use to code non-normative depictions despite filmmaking prohibitions. We also consider the role film/video play in facilitating and challenging the late twentieth-century globalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities.

What is citizenship? Who is a citizen, and who is not? How are citizens made, and how is citizenship contested? How does it feel to (not) be a citizen? When and where does citizenship take place? Is it possible to imagine or practice forms of citizenship beyond the nation-state? In this seminar, we will closely read and engage cultural and scholarly texts that approach citizenship as a legal, spatial, cultural and political process of making and ordering political subjects and social groups. Yet our work together will also point to citizenship as an ongoing project, vulnerable to failure, resistance, and creative transformation. "

This seminar-style course will investigate the contradictory potential of community as both a departure point for emancipatory social transformation, and a site of exclusion, fraught group bonding, and cooptation by the political-economic status quo. Course readings will traverse feminist, antiracist, queer, political-economic, psychoanalytic, and poststructuralist theories that reflect on the limitations and powers of community; ethnographic reflections on the ethics of life within communities; and activist and organizer perspectives. Course assignments will emphasize the value of self-reflexivity, humility, and intellectual rigor in the never-ending work of making sense of lived experiences in community."

But what histories and geographies of education do today's transformations inherit? Education has uneven geographies. Schools have uneven access to power and resources, and so do the people who work at and study within them. Why? Drawing on human geography, anthropology, and sociology, this course investigates how the uneven geographies of education express the contradictions of capitalism and white supremacy. It offers students an opportunity to critically investigate the social and political functions of formal and informal institutions of education, and to bring this wide-ranging investigation back to the politics, economics, and geographies of the Claremont Colleges, as well as to their own future spaces of education and educational labor."

What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?"

After exploring how Western expansion and imperialism affected the domestic development of countries in the region, we transition to the Middle East since World War I, examining the emergence of nationalism and nation-states, the origins and future of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the role of ethnic and religious minorities in political affairs. We then analyze the rise of political Islam, the Middle East since 9/11, and US presence in the region. We will conclude by exploring the recent popular protests in the Arab world and their implications for the fate of the region in the 21st century. Along the way, we ask questions such as these: How did increasing interactions with the West and emerging global trade since the 18th century influence the social and political structures of countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Iran?

Yet in the long sixteenth century, the small kingdom of Portugal was one of the preeminent colonial powers, with extensive if dispersed conquests in Africa and Asia, and a burgeoning plantation-colony in Brazil. This course examines Portugal, the Portuguese Empire, and the trans-imperial borderlands as an entrée into thinking about the First Age of Globalization, c. 1500-1800. We look at the genesis of the Portuguese Empire; relations between colony and metropole; the involvement of other Europeans in the imperial project; and the experience of Portuguese missionaries both within and beyond the borders of the empire. The course concludes by considering the legacies of the Portuguese imperial moment. Particular focus will be on contrasting the imperial experiences in Asia, Africa, and South America.

Consequently, should America be a religious or secular nation?  The extent to which we inhabit a Christian nation is one of the most ubiquitous (and shrill) debates in contemporary American politics.  Central to this debate is the religious (or not-so religious) intentions behind our so-called Founding Fathers, and their plans for our nation's religious establishment.  For some, the Founders were pious and devout men intent on constructing an explicitly Christian nation; for others, they were borderline atheists who envisioned a strict separation of church and state. The historical reality is much more complex than either side readily admits. Burdened by anachronism and oversimplification, this debate is in dire need of thoughtful historical exploration from several angles. This is the work we will perform in this course. We will not only examine and contextualize the complex, conflicting, and often changing views of the Founders themselves, but we will also trace the evolution of this debate from the Revolution to the present.

Whereas the people of the Middle East immediately recognized European powers as colonial invaders, they viewed America in a very positive light. However, the century-long positive perceptions gave way to a more negative and hostile view of the US in the Middle East since the mid-20th century. To understand this radical shift in the relations between the US and the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century. Along the way, we will examine key issues such as America's earliest cultural and educational engagement in the region, Cold War rivalries, oil, US military intervention in the region since the 1950s and its support of authoritarian governments, Arab Nationalisms, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the rise of Islamist Movements.

During the past thirty or so years, scholars of modern Europe have begun to question the degree to which these regimes really were ?totalitarian? in their expression of power. This seminar, therefore, is designed to explore the political and cultural histories of twentieth century Europe?s totalitarian regimes, including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and others via the analytical lenses of various types of foodstuffs and beverages. Ranging in topics from the production of geneticallymodified strains of wheat to the politics of women?s labor and consumption (public/private responsibilities, shopping and cooking, resistance and non-compliance via eating and drinking, etc.) to, finally, the regulation and enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, we will explore these societies ?from above? and ?from below? by evaluating the degree to which everyday eating and drinking impacted both the construction of these notorious dictatorships and the on-the-ground realities of everyday, quotidian experience.

These methods are approached within a thematic and geographic context, involving critical evaluation of evidence and careful written presentation of interpretations and conclusions.  In order to experience history as a discipline, students will be trained to do research using primary sources such as government documents, personal memoirs, letters, newspapers, oral histories, novels, art and visual images found in research libraries and archival collections.  Students will be exposed to important historiographical and theoretical traditions within the fields of European, American, or Asian social, political, and cultural history.

As such, we will read and discuss seminal texts and important themes that have shaped the writing of history in the 19th and 20th centuries. We will examine how historians investigate and interpret events in the past and craft history. We will pay particular attention to how scholars of history employ evidence and structure their narratives. Furthermore, we will explore how in their construction of historical narratives they borrow from other disciplines, such as philosophy, sociology, critical theory, and anthropology. Alongside our theoretical and methodological journey, we will also travel intellectually to a variety of regions like Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, investigating different historiographies to learn how scholars across regions inform each other's works.

We examine interactions between climatic and political and social change; colonial histories of acclimatization, geoengineering, and climatology; connections between climate and ideas about race; the discovery of global warming; and the concept of the Anthropocene. By investigating historical relationships between climate and society, we uncover how the past can inform our understanding of climate change in the present and future."

Today Muslims from different ethnic, political, and social backgrounds constitute over 4 percent of the population of the European Union. The nearly century-long migration of an increasing number of guest workers, professionals, and asylum seekers to countries like Germany, France, Sweden, and Great Britain has established Muslims as a large minority in several EU countries. Yet the growing presence of Muslims in European societies in recent years due to escalating violent conflicts, imperialist intervention, sectarian rifts, and terrorist attacks, triggered heated debates about citizenship, racism, integration and the place of Islam and Muslims in Europe. It also gave rise to a growing right-wing mobilization and anti-Muslim animosity, with surprising similarities to the anti-Semitic propaganda of the past. In this course we will examine questions like this: What are the historical, economic, and political reasons for the migration of the Muslims to Europe? Why are some groups of Muslims in the EU integrated, while others are marginalized? Are Muslims equally represented in European democracies? If not, what are the obstacles that prevent Muslim minorities from participation and institutional access? Letter grade only."

He was, at once, novelist, playwright, philosopher, filmmaker, memoirist, and polemicist. Is this the reason why Genet's works, though lauded by both Sartre and Derrida, today occupy a "minor" position in both the academy and the literate world beyond? Through a close reading of some of his most important texts, this course will consider how Genet deployed and confronted sexuality, family, morality, and nation as interrelated aspects of the operations of inclusion/exclusion so central to modern Western societies.

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and oneâs place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the âessayisticâ and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the âessayâ does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, ChrisMarker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, AgnÃ¨s Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and JaâTovia Gary."

We also will explore another theory: the paradoxical notion that people are happiest when they pursue selfless behavior. This seems to challenge much of traditional economic and evolutionary theory, which posits that humans seek to maximize their own personal self-interest. Thus we will look at the science behind such phenomena as heroism, altruism, morality, and cooperation. Finally we will explore case studies of social entrepreneurs and innovators who seek to make life better for others in the world.||``||"

This course aims at unveiling the Italian fairy tale and folk tale traditions and depictions of the human condition through the works of authors such as Straparola (c.1480-1557) and Basile (1566-1632), the founders of this genre, who first blended realistic and fantastical elements in their collections. Students will read and analyze fairy tales written between the Renaissance and today in relation to the cultural milieu in which they originated and their adaptations in other genres and literary traditions. While it is true that numerous fairy tales were initially aimed at spreading civic and familial values among children and young adults, we will examine how many also contributed to the construction and perpetuation of stereotypes, gender roles, and discrimination. In this course, we will discuss questions concerning the narratological and literary aspects of fairy tales, the relationship between fairy tales and national identity, and the reworking of older fairy tales and the production of new ones, in regard to contemporary culture and its aspirations and anxieties. The course will end with readings of the latest âfairy talesâ inspired by recent events such as the Mediterranean refugee crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic."

However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen.  Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining "Italianess", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.	||``||Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent."

Ferrante, not of immediate success in Italy where her works were originally published, quickly gained international readership with the translation of her tetralogy, L'amica geniale. The effect of Ferrante's international success has resulted in what scholars are coining "the Ferrante effect," an increased attention to works by women writers. In the first half of this course, we will read narratives by and about Elena Ferrante, as well as watch cinematic and serialized adaptations of her work. In the second half of the course, we will explore "the Ferrante effect," reading authors, such as Anna Maria Ortese, Igiaba Scego, and Claudia Durastanti, who have gained or regained recognition through republication or translation as part of "the Ferrante effect." In reading these works, we will question what they have to offer a global audience, what it means to be a "woman writer," and if we can consider "the Ferrante effect" a trans-national feminist movement.

While we will home in on gender poetics and politics, we will also explore broader questions of poetic form, the relations between modernity and history, and America and the world, as well as the poetic treatment of race, class, sexuality, and nation.||``||"

However, Othellos murder of his innocent Venetian wife points to the deadly danger of incorporating foreign others in the body politic. At the center of all interpretations of Othello is the question of race: how are we to understand and analyze Othellos blackness, constructed, as it is, for a white audience and represented by a white author? Moreover, how does Othellos blackness become transcendent, able to stand for the seemingly universal, negative associations that get attached to it in the western imaginary? In this course, we will question the premise that positions Shakespeare's play as offering a reflection of our own culture. In addition, we will consider the questions about who gets to write about and understand blackness, black people, and black experiences as we examine the literary and cultural intents and effects of Othello across the centuries.

Amid these very contemporary and pressing concerns, where then, might Shakespeare fit in? We know that sexism and patriarchy were not invented in the 21st century, they are seemingly, as old as human history and communities. Taking that as our starting point, in this course we will examine how Shakespeares work engages in concerns that we identify as being germane to those of #MeToo. Some of the questions we will be asking during the course include: how does an early modern playwright depict and interrogate notions of sexual violence, exploitation, and coercion? How does his work offer opportunities to intervene in a hyper-patriarchal and masculinist society? What opportunities do his plays suggest for womens power and agency? Is there a way that we can use Shakespeares plays to comment on the sexual politics of our own era?

To grasp why CRT is being mobilized as anti-American or anti-western, we will first aim to understand what CRT is and then explore theories of race beyond legal theory to investigate how race structures our society, institutions, and our lives. Our course aim will be to understand how race, as both whiteness and non-whiteness is a constitutive feature of Anglo-American society and culture.

In order to do so we must first consider whether there was a Renaissance in England. Through our exploration of the literature produced in England during the 16th and 17th centuries, we will answer the above question with an emphatic yes. We will geographically locate the English Renaissance in the royal court, which was the site of much literary production. The court was the seat of power and it attracted those who wanted to gain some of that power for their own use. As we examine this literature, we will investigate the representation of this struggle for power. In addition, we will consider the complexities of patronage, which facilitated much of the writing of the period. We will ask why and how literature is produced and explore the various ways in which English Renaissance writers created their culture. 3 units.||``||||``||"

It is at this intersection of myth and culture where we locate the inquiry of our course. We will explore the generic structure of Romance, the elements that categorize texts as Romance, while also investigating the manner in which Romances offer social critique and commentary. Pertinent concerns of our survey will be representations of gender and difference. We will consider how Romance constructs gender identities that depend on the performance of a kind of hyper-masculinity and femininity and excavate the mechanisms through which Romance produces religious and racial difference. Our study will take us chronologically from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and we will consider whether the concerns of Romance shift between time periods."

Such a paean to England's glory celebrates the country's achievements, even as it laments the decline of the country because of its terrible king. In this course we will trace the construction and representation of England and Britain in English literature. We will consider whether the two terms designate the same thing, or whether some attention needs to be given to the other national identities that Britain signifies, such as Scottish, Welsh, and Irish. We will explore what qualities of the land and people are constituted as English, what as other, and how difference is either absorbed or rejected.

It has been called the play that perfectly captures the issues and anxieties affecting our twenty-first century lives. His play about a black man who rises to the rank of general in the Venetian Army speaks to the possibilities of diversity and a meritocratic system in a multicultural society. However, Othello's murder of his innocent Venetian wife points to the deadly danger of incorporating foreign others in the body politic. At the center of all interpretations of Othello is the question of race: how are we to understand and analyze Othello's blackness, constructed, as it is, for a white audience and represented by a white author? Moreover, how does Othello's blackness become transcendent, able to stand for the seemingly universal, negative associations that get attached to it in the western imaginary? In this course, we will question the premise that positions Shakespeare's play as offering a reflection of our own culture. In addition, we will consider the questions about who gets to write about and understand blackness, black people, and black experiences as we examine the literary and cultural intents and effects of Othello across the centuries. Beginning with Shakespeare, we will consider the way the play, its titular character, and anxieties about race and interracial desire haunt constructions of Africans, blackness, and African Americans in literature by a range of authors, British, American, Black, and White.

While quantum computers are not in our homes yet, companies like Google develop them, and universities like USC work on them. Beyond the hype, the main learning objective of this course is to understand the fundamentals of quantum computing: introduction to quantum mechanics, quantum circuits, the quantum Fourier transform and applications, quantum search algorithms, quantum cryptography. We will discuss some possible applications: will block chains disappear with the advent of quantum computing? (Yes.) Since quantum bits cannot be copied, and thus stolen, then will quantum money become the standard of electronic commerce? (Maybe.)"

A new generation of BIPOC photographers, activists, artists, and poets are challenging, subverting, and highlighting some of the problems and paradoxes, as well as latent potentials of the medium in our current moment.

The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the 'binge model' of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory.

We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response? Is it possible to locate cinematic representations of horror and its experience outside of the horror genre? Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, or MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO or equivalent. Letter grade only."

In this course, we will read film theory and works about Middle Eastern and North African directors. In addition to watching and discussing films, we will ask questions such as these: What role did cinema play in the formation of national and ethnic identities in the region? How does film serve as a medium for transformation from a "traditional" society to a "modern" one? How do feminist directors use their films to negotiate womens rights in the region? How do filmmakers resist censorship by authoritarian and repressive regimes? And finally, what role does cinema play in the representation of this region within global culture?||``|| "

In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more.

What is it about Paul Verlaine's poetry that is so captivating? We will look at the composers of art song who were inspired to set Verlaine's words to music, in the context of the artistic milieu of late nineteenth-century France. Fauré, Debussy, Ravel, and many others all set Verlaine's poetry, each in their own distinctive and illuminating musical style. Discussions will include relationships between text and music, the importance of translation and language, and imagery in music, through the interdisciplinary lenses of sexuality, religion, and class. No background in music or French required, only a curiosity to explore the synergy between poetry and music. Student presentations will be an important component of the course. Letter grade only."

Chronic daily pain affects over 50 million Americans at an estimated cost of over $600 billion annually, and it affects one in five people globally, including children. Despite intense research efforts, the basic biological mechanisms behind chronic pain - and how to effectively treat it - remain mysterious. The course will focus on the neurobiological basis of chronic pain, ranging from genetic risks to the ion channels that convey painful signals to the brain networks that underlie our experience of pain. However, chronic pain is best viewed through the lens of a biopsychosocial model, considering the biological, psychological and sociological factors that shape each individual's experience of chronic pain. In this seminar, we will examine these factors through peer-reviewed primary research papers, articles in the popular press, and guest appearances by pain researchers."

To what extent ought it be so? To explore these questions, this course will make stops at important moments in the history of philosophysuch as Descartes' armchair philosophizing and Carol Gilligan's interviewing women about moralityon its way to the present movement called "experimental philosophy," wherein philosophers conduct experiments similar to those in cognitive and social science in order to address philosophical questions. Students will learn how philosophers think about intuitions and the roles they play in grounding and challenging theories in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc. In addition, students will explore important intersections between philosophy and science, such as the emergence of neurophilosophy and moral psychology in the 20th century. The armchair isn't going anywhere, but neither is the question of which methods of inquiry, namely those empirically informed, are part of the philosopher's toolkit in addressing diverse questions about mind, knowledge, and morality."

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as "hybrid effective governance," "heterarchy," "areas of limited statehood," "oligopolies of violence," and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.

Moynihan wrote, "The immigration process is the single most important determinant of American foreign policy... This process regulates the ethnic composition of the American electorate. Foreign policy responds to that ethnic composition. It responds to other things as well, but probably first of all to the primary fact of ethnicity." In this class we will revisit Glazer and Moynihan's proposition by examining the role of ethnic/racial groups in shaping U.S. foreign policy. The current context provides us with a unique opportunity to revisit their proposition given that ethnic/racial groups in American politics are more numerous and politically influential."

There are periods in U.S. history where large-scale immigration dramatically rises and periods where it declines to a trickle. The rise and fall of mass migration is the result of changes in U.S. immigration policy. But these changes are not merely the outcome of political battles. They are also the outcome of battles over beliefs and ideas about immigrants. Throughout American history, debates over admissible and inadmissible persons are at their core debates about desirable and undesirable traits groups or individuals are believed to possess. This course is an examination of the immigration beliefs of Americans. "

This course will upset these perceptions by drawing on an immense corpus of African Christian writings penned between the second and seventeenth centuries on spirituality, the body, and ritual traditions that were written as much in native African languages (e.g., Coptic, Ge'ez, Old Nubian, Amharic)as they were in foreign lanugages (e.g., Greek and Latin), and that transformed the contours of Christianity in ways still evident today.

From these and various other roots that are "mashed up" and represented, the musical styles create alternate universes/futures within the existing "real" universe, and in that the creation, there is a religiosity that demands our attention. Drawing from Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and Brian Massumi's activist philosophy, we will consider how electronic music creates fluid, vibrant, and progressive communities that reshape how we understand certain "constants" in the world. The class will pay close attention to how electronic music articulates critiques against systems of power and how said critiques serve a religious function in the world. Students will listen to electronic music, attend shows amidst several electronic music communities, explore the contours of religious meaning in the genres, and learn this exciting and relatively unexplored corner of the religious studies landscape in very embodied ways. Letter grade only."

In the current climate of rising political polarization, religion plays a critical role in shaping and reinforcing social and political cleavages on a variety of issues. Recent controversies surrounding abortion, gun control, LGBTQ+ rights, and COVID health protocols spurred vitriolic debates in U.S. civic spaces. Sociologists have pointed to the often-neglected role of religion in shaping public opinion, political decision-making, and forms of civic participation related to these issues. As a result, the âwall of separationâ between religion and state appears to be not as insurmountable as the founding founders might have imagined it to be. Importantly, the focus of sociologists interested in the relationship between religion, politics, and power continues to be on Christian traditions. The recent growing attention to white Christian nationalism is an example of this trend. This course offers a different perspective by engaging students in an analysis of how both Christian and non-Christian traditions, particularly Islam and Muslim civic practices, influence (or are influenced by) the relationship between religion, power, and politics in the contemporary U.S. context.

How do these principles influence us in the present, and how might they influence the future of theatrical performance? Students will formulate their own aesthetic, philosophical, and critical points of view about theatre. Presentations, papers, and weekly discussion will lead towards the final project: a manifesto/ thesis proposal in the format of a TED-style talk. Special attention is paid to equipping students to enter the field of performance and/or graduate studies after graduation. "

In this writing course, we look at how identity is storied in literature in order to turn that lens back on ourselves as writers. How do we use our writing in everyday life to construct identitieseven when writing about things other than ourselves? Why is our own writing so often a site of competing allegiances? And how do our identities as writers shift when we write in different contexts? We'll probe identity by reading and writing in a variety of genresfrom exploratory essays to experimental memoirs, from public letters to philosophical treatisesall with the goal of becoming more reflective and agile writers."

Yet, what do we mean by a good education? What literacy practices are privileged? And how do race, class, geography, and gender influence access? In this writing seminar, we investigate the cultural and communicative practices that define literacy in different educational settings. We begin by analyzing the literacy autobiographies of public intellectuals like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Mike Rose, before composing our own narratives about other people, perspectives, and institutions that have shaped our sense of ourselves as writers. Next, we draw on research from sociology, writing studies, and linguistics to reassess problematic representations of literacy in education policies and popular culture. For a capstone project, students write op-eds on an issue in education or literacy that interests them. Possible topics may include standardized tests and the college admissions process, language and identity, or the emergence of new literacies in the digital age."

Through surveys and interviews with Claremont students, we will produce original research about how this current ||``||generation of college students is finding its voice through writing. What kinds of writing inside and outside of the classroom are students doing? How do students report finding meaning in their work? What helps writers challenge ||``||themselves and grow?

This approach transcends genre, and can be exercised in writing that is otherwise described as the non-fiction, or documentary novel, biography, autobiography or autofiction. We will be writing two original texts during the semester, working under the influence of selected texts by writers such as Janet Flanner, George Orwell, Carlos Monsivais, Colette, Frank Sargeson and Chester Himes.

How can writing about other topics reveal more about someone than a plain catalogue of attributes? In this course we'll read, discuss, and produce autobiographical works that approach their subjects head-on as well as those that reveal their authors more insidiously. We'll ask of all our authors: What do we know for sure that they never quite articulate? What do we know about them that they might not know themselves? Authors may include Deb Olin Unferth, Amy Fusselman, Joe Brainard, Vivian Gornick, Eula Biss, Jamaica Kincaid, Maggie Nelson, Virginia Woolf."

Passerby, open your eyes," said the poet Adam Zagajewski. In this class, we'll focus on writing what we see, whether it's through our eyes or other senses. What can it mean to describe? What magic can be wrought by translating the physical world into words? We'll work rigorously on short pieces of our own prose, and we'll read selected texts by, among others, Agnes Martin, Shirin Neshat, Susan Sontag, Esmé Weijun Wang, and Maria Gainza.||``||"
