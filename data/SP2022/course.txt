Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.

|#|AFRI010B AF|^|Research Methods|^|SIDO|^|05.0201|^|PO|^|Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary field that examines the historical, cultural, literary, aesthetic, political, social, and economic experiences and knowledges of peoples of African origin in both Africa and the African diaspora. In this course, we will consider several disciplines, such as art history, psychology, and philosophy, and their intersection with Africana Studies. We will discuss how these disciplines approach Africana Studies and how Africana Studies scholars can employ disciplinary lenses. In the process of producing a research paper this semester, you will explore and select the methods for which you will conduct your research.
|#|AFRI114  AF|^|Unruly Bodies:  Black Womanhood|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|In this course we will explore and critically analyze representations of black womanhood in popular culture. Closely reading texts, television, music, comedy, and artistic works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we will think through some of the processes by which black women's bodies are socially, politically, and culturally constructed as dangerous, disruptive, and out of control. Another major goal of the course is to consider the various strategies black women take up to foreground pleasure, and various ways of seeing black bodies as healthy and adequate. We can do so by examining competing versions of 'black womanhood,' looking at how ideas about the discourse  circulate around the hegemonic idea of black women and black femininity as unruly. Letter grade only.|#|AFRI116  AF|^|Marxism & the Black Radical Trad|^|SAFR|^|05.0201|^|SC|^|Marxism has had a long and vibrant relationship with Black liberation movements worldwide - from early twentieth-century Harlem to postwar anti-colonial struggles to the Black Panther Party. Such thinkers and activists have linked their efforts to Marx, Lenin, and other central figures, while simultaneously molding Marxism to address the circumstances of people of African descent and infusing the philosophy with approaches from the Black radical tradition. The course will examine classic Marxist texts alongside Black radical contributions and interventions to deepen our understanding of racial capitalism and to illuminate possibilities for liberation that come from a Marxist praxis deeply engaged with important approaches in Black thought. |#|AFRI119  JT|^|Africana Journal & New Media|^|SAFR|^|05.0201|^|SC|^|Students research conceptual frameworks toward creating and maintaining an Africana Studies journal. The journal may include new media formats such as blogs and podcasts, in addition to traditional article formats. Following the practices of Black feminist theory, the journal encourages writing that includes authorial experience and positionality.|#|AFRI121  AF|^|Africana Philosophy|^|MIDS|^|05.0201|^|CM|^|Philosophical thought and the philosophical cannon cannot be restricted to the 'great thinkers' of western history. This course will be a general introduction to Africana Philosophy. We will unveil not only that philosophy is more than the western world and has points of origin in other places, such as Africa, but we will also discover how Africana philosophy serves as a challenge to the integrity of integral concepts and themes in modern western philosophy; for example, the subject, freedom, the human, and even ontology. We will achieve these insights through a survey of thinkers, writers, and people who address themes such as traditional africana thought, black existentialism, black feminism, post colonialism, whiteness, double consciousness, and afro-pessimism. Cross-listed as PHIL109 CM.|#|AFRI127  AF|^|Hip Hop, Reggae, and Religion|^||^|05.0201|^|SC|^|Hip-hop and reggae are among the worldâs most popular musical art forms.  Contextualizing the emergence of these cultural formations, we will interrogate the dynamic relationships between them and the religio-political imagination of the Black Atlantic.  We will pay particular attention to the ways that the various cultures of hip-hop and reggae offer critique to Christianity and contemporary arrangements of power.  Listening to the religio-political perspectives expressed in these cultural formations students will question whether or not the music provides a prophetic challenge to the status quo of our political and economic arrangements.  Giving attention to the music, from the Negro Spirituals, to contemporary Hip Hop and Dancehall, we will contextualize it with an interest in understanding the relationship between their religious and political visions.  Weekly, we will encounter material from numerous genres as we theorize the music.  Assignments will include discussion posts, presentations, a music review, and a final paper.|#|AFRI128  AF|^|Black Phenomenology|^|MIDS|^|05.0201|^|CM|^|Phenomenology is a school of philosophy that emerged at the turn of the 20th century and is described by its forefather Edmund Husserl as a philosophy of experience. This class will explore how black experience challenges the Eurocentric proclivities that structure phenomenology's fundamental tenets. 'Black phenomenology' is not a school of thought in opposition to phenomenology, but an engagement with different black thinkers who in articulating black experience, have come to reject, modify, and, in some cases, adopt in non-intuitive ways ideas concepts and frameworks from classical phenomenology and its many outshoots. Cross-listed as PHIL142  CM. Prerequisite: AFRI125 AF or AFRI121 AF.|#|AFRI134  PO|^|Black Comic Cultures|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|African American humor can be traced to the period of enslavement, largely an underground phenomenon until the middle of the 20th century when performers like Richard Pryor and Dick Gregory brought it to the mainstream. The global rise of black comedy as a commodity and marker of identity in the 21st century demands that we reconsider how black cultural formations like comedy are embodied, evaluated, and critiqued within American culture. This seminar serves as an introduction to the history and practices of black comic cultures, and focuses on major themes, styles, and historical events that inform contemporary genres of black comedy. We will use comedy as a means to help us think about how American cultures and identities have been shaped, challenged, and transformed by way of performance.|#|AFRI144A AF|^|Black Women, Feminism(s) & Arts|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Interdisciplinary seminar explores the ascension of intersectional feminism(s) produced by trailblazing Black women artists, theorists, and activists. Assigned creative and critical interventions interrogate the ways interlocking constructs of race (aestheticized moral ranking system), gender, sexuality, class, religion, and citizenship inform self-perceptions, social status, creative practices, as well as political and economic relationships of power. Situating contemporary feminist work historically, thematically- organized materials highlight key written and visual texts by the nineteenth century and twentieth-century foremothers. Students will compare and contrast strategies for living, thinking, and visualizing love-driven efforts to raise consciousness, manifest political and economic change, and energize social transformations across the African diaspora.|#|AFRI149  AF|^|Africana Political Theory|^|SAFR|^|05.0201|^|SC|^|Given the Black dispersal throughout the world, Africana Political Theory will analyze the intersection of race, class, gender, and sexuality in the formation of political structures throughout the African Diaspora. Utilizing the texts of Black scholars throughout the Diaspora, the course will provide a broad look into Black politics. |#|AFRI149  AF|^|Africana Political Theory|^|SAFR|^|05.0201|^|SC|^|Given the Black dispersal throughout the world, Africana Political Theory will analyze the intersection of race, class, gender, and sexuality in the formation of political structures throughout the African Diaspora.

This course will reside at the intersection of two interdisciplinary academic fields, American Studies and Sound Studies. How does an attention to the sonic clarify our understanding of American nationhood, empire, and identity in the twenty-first century? Does listening to American culture reveal knowledge that would otherwise be rendered invisible or unreachable? Conversely, in what ways does American Studies? persistent return to the personal and communal help situate the theoretical concepts drawn from other disciplines?  We will engage with primary and secondary sources from a wide range of disciplines, including media studies, anthropology, history, musicology, and sound art in order to better understand the role of the sonic in our constantly developing conceptualizations of "America."|#|AMST128  SC|^|Race, Space, and Difference|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|This course is an introduction to critical scholarship on race and space in the United States.

cultural context. Students will become familiar with basic concepts and qualitative methods in the 
social sciences, including ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of face-to-face communication. 
We look for ways of answering questions such as these:

 How do everyday conversational practices create solidarity between people, or set them apart from 
one another? How does talk reflect and create relations of power?
 How do words combine with other semiotic modalities (gesture, facial expression, prosody) to 
convey subtle messages?
 Why do miscommunications arise, even between people who speak the same language?
 How do children learn to speak not only grammatically, but also appropriately?
 How does language shape our thoughts or the ways we perceive the world?

In this course, we explore language  as a complex form of social actionnot merely a vehicle for 
communicating thoughts and meanings, but a means of creating the social world. We consider ways 
that language acts on us, and ways that we act through language: achieving relationships, 
constituting identities, constructing norms and patterns of thought, and positioning ourselves and 
others in relation to global systems of power and inequality.

traditional interrelationships of Native American ethnic groups with their various
environments. Are patterns of collecting wild resources or farming primary foods
environmentally determined? How does the physical environment affect a groups
social system, politics, art, religion? What impact do these cultural factors have
on a groups utilization of its environment? We will examine these and other issues
through class discussions and readings. We will consider several regions of North
America in our study of such groups as the Inuit, Kwakiutl, Cahuilla, Hopi, Navajo,
Dakota and Iroquois.|#|ANTH016  PZ|^|Intro to Nepal|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|The course provides an introduction to the history and

A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay, and it culminates in the student presenting an oral piece (resembling a TED Talk) to their peers on a research topic of their choosing. |#|ANTH053  PO|^|Language and Globalization|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Through readings, films, and podcasts, this course covers how language and human movement have been intertwined over time, from early human dispersals through modern migrations.

This class will examine the social, cultural, and political consequences of Chinaâs global prominence. Particular attention will be paid to national discourse, resources distribution, generational differences, labor, consumer and internet culture, sex and gender, ethnic groups, the Coronavirus pandemic, and projects of building global infrastructure. The class is a seminar that will combine short lectures with discussions based on the close reading of articles by journalists, anthropologists, and historians. |#|ANTH100  PO|^|Anthropology of Sound|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|From reflecting on the ethics of listening to religious cassettes in Egypt to listening with oceanographers as they use sound to know and to navigate, anthropologists increasingly do ethnography with their ears. This new research represents a conscious democratization of the senses. This course provides a survey of the anthropology of sound while asking students to imagine futures for sound ethnography through praxis. We will examine how sound 'and music' are perceived, produced, disciplined, and silenced across cultures. In doing so, we will read ethnography, philosophy and sound studies to understand how sound relates to perception, space, politics, and culture.

The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present.

His film essay is an exorcism of the world, a melancholy, critical farewell-but Sans Soleil is also about the world, a visual celebration of that world: at once exorcism and homage; a leave-taking and a reverent, fine-grained representation. That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the "writing on the walls of the prison house of culture," a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a "matter of life and death." We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation. Assignments will be both written and visual; you will learn to film your own essay.

|#|ANTH114  SC|^|Science, Medicine & Colonialism|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This seminar examines the role of empire in shaping medical and scientific knowledge and practice. Beginning in the eighteenth century, as major scientific developments were unfolding in Europe and the United States, these regions were engaging in colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas. These two processes were often linked. Colonial aims influenced medico-scientific paradigms, and emergent scientific knowledge shaped how colonizers governed and controlled populations. This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges. Throughout, we engage with concepts of the postcolonial and the settler colonial to help us understand the complexity of connections between past and present. |#|ANTH115  SC|^|Stuff:Social Life of Commodities|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|The world is becoming overstuffed by stuff.

We will begin with an overview of the use of cooperative filmmaking efforts and community-based history projects in various contexts. Students will learn about the ways in which cooperative and collaborative filmmaking practices can challenge the paradigms of commercial filmmaking in terms of content, production and distribution. Students will also have the opportunity to collaborate with a community-based organization in the city of Pomona to produce short videos as part of an ongoing filmmaking practice for social change.|#|ANTH127  SC|^|Settler Colonialism|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This seminar examines processes of settler colonialism and the experiences of indigenous peoples. The central premise of this course is that colonialism is an ongoing process in many parts of the world; we will examine how it operates through sites such as sovereignty, land and territory, medicine, gender and sexuality, and others. At the same time, we will look at how indigenous practices and movements have sought to carve out spaces for critique and resistance.|#|ANTH128  SC|^|Refugees, Migrants, Citizenship|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Who has the right to travel, to remain, or to belong?

How do exclusion and inclusion impact ideas of citizenship, race, and identity? How is mobility enabled, disabled, and regulated by state and non-state actors in ways that impact integration and belonging? In working through these questions, students will conduct anthropological analyses to draw out the intersections of migration, identity, and citizenship. |#|ANTH129  SC|^|Politics of Public Art|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|In this class we will explore the politics of public art. While we will look at the political messaging of public art, we will also seek to understand how public art, through its integration into a social geography, has a political impact beyond its meaning. We will see how art claims public space and structures social action, how art shapes social groups, and how art channels economic flows or government power. We will examine how art enters into urban contest and global inequality.|#|ANTH139  PO|^|Collapse and Transformation|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course introduces multiple approaches to the study of complexity and collapse in the archaeological record, focusing on researchers' attempts to understand the development of social inequality in diverse societies ranging from North America to Oceana to Africa to Western Asia as well as to see how institutionalized inequality led to complex social formations in Mesopotamia (2500-1600 BC), Egypt (2700-1780 BC), China (1200-950 BC), and the New World (Maya [400 BC - AD 900], Aztec [AD 1400-1500], and Inca [AD 1500]).

By taking infrastructures seriously as processes that can be made to enable (or impede) certain kinds of relations or movements, as well as devices that can function as important symbolic projects, this class will raise a number of interrelated questions. What sorts of histories become apparent when looking at the emergence of particular kinds of infrastructures? How can we approach questions of environmental justice by studying the mundane infrastructures of daily life? Which communities are made more vulnerable to risk by particular kinds of infrastructure planning, and how can we address these questions using qualitative, ethnographic methods?

It provides an introduction to the prehistory of the peoples of Mesoamerica (comprising all of Guatemala and Belize and parts of Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras) from roughly 2000 BCE into the 16th century CE. It seeks to provide a definition of their common cultural background and to examine the archaeological record for the origins of these various societies and their rise into complex indigenous civilizations that were finally dismantled following contact with the Spanish in the sixteenth century. Emphasis will be placed on the nature of the archaeological interpretation of these native American cultures and on the diachronic and dynamic relationships between highland Mexican and lowland Maya groups.

|#|ANTH189L PO|^|Linguistic Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course provides an intensive introduction to selected theories, methods, and themes in linguistic anthropology, one of the discipline's four subfields. The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists' inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper. |#|ANTH189L PO|^|Linguistic Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course provides an intensive introduction to selected theories, methods, and themes in linguistic anthropology, one of the discipline's four subfields.

We will begin with an overview of the use of visual material, film and photography in both anthropological fieldwork as well as popular documentary films of the early 20th century. While the formal and aesthetic language of documentary film is often taken to signal "reality" in popular understandings of the genre, how has this framing been challenged within visual anthropology? Students will learn about the changing relationship of anthropology to visual practices through a number of screenings, readings and lectures that explore issues of power and representation and the visual medium.|#|ANTH189P PO|^|Visual Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|The course focuses on the history and development of documentary film and the emergence of ethnographic film within the discipline of anthropology.

It examines the form and function of architecture and works of art as well as the social, historical and cultural contexts, patterns of use, and evolving meanings attributed to art by the users. Themes include the creation of a distinctive visual culture in the emerging Islamic polity; the development of urban institutions; key architectural types such as the mosque, madrasa, caravanserai, dervish lodge and mausoleum; art objects and the arts of the illustrated book; self-representation; cultural interconnections along trade and pilgrimage routes; westernization and modernization in art and architecture. Letter grade only. |#|ARHI121  PO|^|Islamic Painting|^|PARH|^||^|PO|^|This seminar focuses on the production of paintings, mostly but not exclusively miniatures in books, in the Islamic world. A particular focus will lie on the Muslim empires of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, namely the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal realms, stretching from the Balkans to Bengal. During this period, illustrated books were popular objects of high-level patronage, and numerous examples have survived that allow a detailed study of the implications of these images. Themes discussed will include: figural representation in Islam; patronage and court culture; gender and the body; illustrations of literature and history; images of Sufis ceremonies; portraiture; images of animals and nature; the impact of European prints and paintings; space and landscape. Letter grade only. |#|ARHI122  PO|^|Sensory Spaces, Tactile Objects|^|PARH|^||^|PO|^|This course examines the role of the senses in art and architecture to move beyond conceptions of art history that prioritize vision. While the experience of art is often framed in terms of seeing, the other senses were crucially involved in the creation of buildings and objects in the medieval and early modern periods, just as they are in the work of present-day artists: think Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Rooms. Textiles and ceramic vessels invite touch, gardens involve the smell of flowers, sacred spaces were built to amplify the sound of prayers and chants. This class will examine how multisensory experience operates in the medieval and early modern arts of Eurasia, and how it can be experienced today, both in historical objects and contemporary art. Readings will range from medieval poetry and multisensory art histories to contemporary discussions of the senses in design and anthropology. Digital Humanities will be part of the course experience.

A particular emphasis will be placed on cultural developments in both regions; the depiction of the other in Latin and Arabic chronicles; the cultural assimilation of the Crusaders into the Holy Land as they settled there, became acquainted with local customs, and transformed holy places, Jerusalem in particular. Once Jerusalem returned to Muslim rule in the twelfth century, some of these changes were undone, while others remained in place. This direct contact also had a profound impact on art in medieval Europe, through pilgrims' accounts and objects such as glass, metalwork, and textiles produced in Syria or Egypt that became part of church treasuries.

Mediterranean cities under the rubric of art history, architecture, literature, and history. |#|ARHI177  SC|^|Dada and Surrealism|^|SARH|^||^|SC|^|Politically subversive and aesthetically explosive, Dada and Surrealism each set out to revolutionize Western culture and succeeded in transforming the world of art. Working in painting, sculpture, performance, still photography, motion pictures, literature, and readymades, the Dadaists and Surrealists redefined these mediums while also pioneering tactics of abstraction, automatism, and montage that remain vital, relevant, and widespread. This seminar considers the history of the two movements, beginning with Dada?s emergence in New York and Zurich in the mid 1910s and that of Surrealism in 1920s Paris, and addresses their ongoing impact around the world.   |#|ARHI178  PO|^|Black Aesth/Poli (Re)presentatn|^|PARH|^||^|PO|^|Course examines the visual arts (including painting, sculpture, photography, prints, textiles, mixed media, installations, performance, independent film and video) produced by people of African descent in the United States from the colonial era to the present.

Starting with questions that explore the uses (and abuses) of the rubric "Asian American Art," this class will consider different contexts for work by Asian American artists and the ways that they can illuminate conversations about race in the U.S., the role that art can play in coalescing complex notions of community, and the nexus of art and its public reception both historically and at our contemporary moment. We will also chart intersections and parallels with contemporaneous African American, LatinX/ChicanX, and Feminist art movements. Class work will include responses to readings and artworks.

We will consider how, when, and why a building entered the canon of Persian art history (or was excluded from it), how its appearance and function have evolved over time, and how its ground reality compares with its often veneered and fragmented treatment in the museum. While the course focuses mainly on sites within historical Iran, it also considers the recasting of Persian architecture in more recent centuries in such distant locales as Honolulu, Copenhagen, and Kuala Lumpur. In doing so, we balance the study of Persian architecture between the past and present, local and global, and a wide variety of stakeholders and interests.|#|ARHI186W PO|^|Interrog Whiteness:Race,Sex,Rep|^|PARH|^||^|PO|^|Interdisciplinary course studying select African disaporan visual arts interrogating linguistic, conceptual, and visual solipsisms contributing to the construction and reproduction of whiteness in aesthetics, studio art, film, video, and social media.

This course examines how the Korean War has been remembered transculturally, especially by those who contest the dominant historical narrative of American benevolence. We will consider how writers and filmmakers remember âThe Forgotten Warâ differently, and what these representations say about the positionalities of the people depicted in each work. What is deconstructed and what is produced in the intercultural dynamic of the interaction of different historical memories? How did the Korean War affect existing metanarratives of race and nation, both in the United States and abroad?

The course will focus on major infectious diseases like COVID-19, flu, antibiotic resistance, and HIV. Through these âcase studiesâ, we will consider the basic biology of infectious diseases, as well as how treatments are affected by the evolution of those pathogens.

Working from the idea that "you don't play boxing", this course introduces students to an exploitative and high-risk sport that vastly differs from other professional sporting organizations. Starting in the late 19th century, students will interrogate the sociopolitical, historical, and cultural dimensions of boxing and the ways fighters have disrupted and reinforced dominant understandings of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation. Collectively, we will ask: What does boxing tell us about the world? What does it obscure? What are the implications?

communities in the United States and borderlands? What forms of research are ethical? How 
do we tell the story of people who may live in the shadows of the state and the official 
archives? How do we produce knowledge from our discipline? How can knowledge 
generated in the field make change in the world and inspire social justice?
The research and methods course provides a basic introduction to research methods and 
archives. Students will engage in the interdisciplinary theoretical and practical study and 
application of methods and archival research design. We will examine foundational texts in 
the field as well as emerging research in the field (and in Ethnic Studies generally). We will
explore a range of research methodologies in field, and, more broadly, in Ethnic Studies. The
readings are organized around questions, approaches, and critiques that will help students
develop qualitative research skills (oral history/ethnography) and archival experience while also
considering the politics of research and representation. The class will interrogate the ways in 
which the field challenges hegemonic academic discourses and epistemologies.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over 'illegality' further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.|#|CHST130  CH|^|Voices & Stories CL Communities|^|PCHS|^||^|PO|^|Drawing on Chicana-Latina feminisms, this course centers story-telling as (1) a method to (re)claim Chicanx-Latinx voices and histories in multiple spaces and institutions, including families and communities; and (2) as a form of everyday resistance and institutional transformation.

Other topics will include the historical production of the undocumented population in the U.S., demographic trends, the educational, work, and family lives of immigrant youth, and the shifting policy terrain including the impact of DACA and its culmination. Students will have the opportunity to engage in a collaborative project to develop deeper knowledge about a single issue related to undocumented immigration and/or immigrant youth. This collaborative project may include qualitative research and/or a community-engaged learning project with the aim of helping students engage with the principles of social justice and collaborative leadership through critical reflection within the classroom. Letter grade only.|#|CHST136  CH|^|Latinx Social Movements|^|PCHS|^||^|PO|^|Latin/o/a/xs have historically used grassroots community organizing and social movement participation to press for socio-political change. Yet, national discourse often falls back on stereotypes of Latino/as' political apathy. This class will explore competing definitions of political participation. By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino/a/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of "Latino/a" social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants' rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino/a social movements historically. |#|CHST140  CH|^|Sanctuary Struggles in the SGV|^|PCHS|^||^|PO|^|Organized into two parts, this workshop-based class provides a collective space to learn about, document and engage with the current struggles for sanctuary in our local communities. During the first part of the semester, we will read and discuss approaches to community-based research and the 1980s sanctuary movement for Central Americans. Thereafter, we focus on the struggles for sanctuary cities and schools in the San Gabriel Valley and Inland Empire since the 2016 presidential election. Working together, we will collect, review, and analyze oral histories, city and school board minutes, newspaper articles, and sanctuary resolutions from cities such as Pomona, Claremont, La Puente, West Covina, San Dimas, Upland, Glendora, and San Gabriel. Some attention will also be given to current movements by local religious organizations. Our class will culminate in a co-created project that visually documents and helps to preserve these histories of struggle.

Here, through close reading and discussion of battlefield harangues and Assembly deliberations, of despotic tyranny and democratic nudging, we will explore together the contours of these ancient Greek conversations as leadership evolved and eventually began to be theorized. Our seminar readings will include both modern scholarship and ancient sources, the latter drawn primarily from Homer's Iliad, from the historiographies of Herodotus and Thucydides, and from the writings of the fourth-century scholar-warrior Xenophon (including his Socratic Memorabilia, his campaign memoir Anabasis, and his Cyropaedia, an extended meditation on the ideal leader).

Do we have evidence of counter-cultural activity or gender/sexuality-based subcultures? In order to develop our own answers to these questions, we will conduct a theoretically-informed exploration of the intersections between gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social class, and political status in the ancient Roman world. We will draw on literary and material evidence, including poetry, medical texts, architecture, and visual art. By utilizing feminist and anti-racist approaches and actively making thoughtful comparisons with our own lived experiences, students in this course will become a community of scholars engaged in a meaningful inquiry into gender and sexuality in Ancient Rome and today. <a href="https://romasexualis2020.wordpress.com"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>|#|CLAS113  PO|^|History of Sexuality: Clas World|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|The ancient Greeks and Romans categorized sexuality differently from modern Westerners.

What are the aims of archaeology? How have the motivations and methods of early archaeologists and collectors defined what we know now? Could current projects radically transform our understanding of the ancient world? In this course, we will work together as an intellectual community to deepen our understanding of ethical issues raised by the practices of archaeology, museology, and the collection and display of material culture. We will begin by studying several archaeological projects and artifact collections from the ancient Mediterranean, including Troy, Knossos, the Parthenon Marbles, and the antiquities collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. Students will then identify, research, and present relevant case studies of significant interest to the students themselves. By applying diverse theoretical models, including actor-network modeling, thing theory, decoloniality, and feminism, we will develop our own methodologies for the study of archaeology in social context. <a href="https://archaeologyandsociety2020.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>|#|CLAS121  JT|^|Classical Mythology|^|CJT|^||^|PZ|^|This class surveys some of the prominent myths of the ancient Greek and Roman world, with attention to material culture, literary interpretation, theory of myth and modern reception.

This course will examine closely those so-called "enemies of Roman order": religious cults, superstition, personal corruption and excess, popular violence, the Roman obsession with death, the radical decline from Classical models of life and art. Authors read include Ovid, Lucan, Seneca, Petronius, Tacitus, Juvenal, Apuleius.|#|CLAS150  SC|^|Spec Top in Ancient Studies|^|SCLA|^|16.1299|^|SC|^|A research seminar that focuses on specific historical periods, societies, problems, or themes.

Drawing on archeological and other evidence, this seminar explores cities like Alexandria, Ephesos, Constantinople, and Palmyra (among many others) and considers questions such as how cities with very different histories adapted (or didn't) to the Roman empire; interacted with each other and with foreign powers; and negotiated, resisted, and reacted to cultural developments like the rise of Christianity and Islam. We will also explore broader questions about modern and ancient concepts of east and west, empire, various "izaitions," and notions of decline. This seminar includes a research project. |#|CLAS164  SC|^|Pompeii & the Cities of Vesuvius|^|SCLA|^||^|SC|^|Explores the archaeology, history, and art and architecture of the ancient Roman towns of the Bay of Naples buried by the eruption of Mt.

Recently, interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has rebounded, while the computational theory of mind has developed the thesis that all minds are machines. We will explore the history, philosophy, and psychology of mental machines by studying computational/cognitive psychology and the bi-directional influences of society and computing. We will examine traditional symbolic AI, deep learning by artificial neural networks, statistical learning techniques, and robotics. Finally, we will ponder the possibility that creating machines with common sense might require insights from developmental psychology. Ultimately, we will contemplate how research on AI illuminates human cognition, and vice versa.|#|CORE001  SC|^|Histories of the Present|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|Core I. Histories of the Present: Community.
With "Histories of the Present," Core I faculty and students will explore the relationship between historically informed critical thinking and our engagement with contemporary issues and debates. Our investigations seek to highlight the categories and values that we may take to be given or obvious and the ways in which the conventional or received understanding and application of these categories and values can prevent us from seeing ourselves and the world--social and natural--in other ways. 

Core I takes up this task through an examination of communities. Starting with the question "What is a community?" we look at both large imagined communities such as modern nation-states and religious groups and smaller, more intimate groups that we regularly label as a "community." We ask: How are communities formed and transformed? What role does historical memory and forgetting play in the creation of community? How are communities at once inclusive and exclusionary? What role do performance and memory play in the formation and transformation of communities? Any when are communities beneficial and when are they potentially harmful?

In this course, we examine the ways in which communities are created and transformed through political acts, religious practices, military intervention, cultural performances, social networks, and bonding. In conjunction with this, we critique the ways in which practices of overt and implicit exclusion along the lines of birth, class, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and religious beliefs limit the possibility of belonging. We explore the ways in which individuals and communities define and represent themselves in accordance with and in resistance to the dominant powers that often determine a community's boundaries. We also explore how communities work in resistance to transform their own and other's political, economic and social condition.

With "Histories of the Present," Core I faculty and students will explore the relationship between historically informed critical thinking and our engagement with contemporary issues and debates. Our investigations seek to highlight the categories and values that we may take to be given or obvious and the ways in which the conventional or received understanding and application of these categories and values can prevent us from seeing ourselves and the world--social and natural--in other ways. 

Core I takes up this task through an examination of communities. Starting with the question "What is a community?" we look at both large imagined communities such as modern nation-states and religious groups and smaller, more intimate groups that we regularly label as a "community." We ask: How are communities formed and transformed? What role does historical memory and forgetting play in the creation of community? How are communities at once inclusive and exclusionary? What role do performance and memory play in the formation and transformation of communities? Any when are communities beneficial and when are they potentially harmful?

In this course, we examine the ways in which communities are created and transformed through political acts, religious practices, military intervention, cultural performances, social networks, and bonding. In conjunction with this, we critique the ways in which practices of overt and implicit exclusion along the lines of birth, class, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and religious beliefs limit the possibility of belonging. We explore the ways in which individuals and communities define and represent themselves in accordance with and in resistance to the dominant powers that often determine a community's boundaries. We also explore how communities work in resistance to transform their own and other's political, economic and social condition.

We will use climate change as an opportunity to explore the impact of our work on society. There are four primary components of that exploration: critical analysis of the social context of STEM, the expansion and application of concepts from the core to understand this social-technical problem, collaborative projects that promote positive change in the world, and communicating our project designs and professional choices. Plenary sessions will explore topics such as environmental justice, earth system science, the relation between expertise and power, policy processes, data science, community engagement, multidisciplinary collaboration, impactful careers, and science communication. Individual sections will explore particular climate-related issues in greater depth. Final team projects will challenge students to apply these concepts in proposals for climate solutions. Open to HMC students only. Open to sophomores; juniors and seniors by permission. Countas as departmental HSA course.

|#|CORE179B HM|^|Climate Change in Context|^|HMID|^||^|HM|^|This version of the "impact course" leverages knowledge and skills developed in the Core to understand the roots and possible remedies for climate change from a variety of intersecting perspectives. Particular attention will be given to the historical, cultural, and economic contexts of anthropogenic climate change as frameworks within which technological and political solutions must operate. We expect this course to meet once weekly, likely in the evening. Content will be roughly balanced between STEM and humanistic/social scientific approaches. Assessments will likely include problem sets, short response papers, class debates, and a final project. Weekly meetings will include small group work as well as lecture/discussion.

Like 35, CS for Inquiry is about breadth-of-application, not depth-of-specialty. The course will exercise computing skills, especially for investigations beyond computing per se. Like Computer Science 5, this course uses Python as its implementation language. Unlike Computer Science 5, whose goal is mostly from-scratch coding, this course takes advantage of one of Python's particular strengths: its libraries.

Students learn and use a new library -- or two, or three, or four -- each week, building familiarity via a mix of specified and open-ended challenges. In the last part of the course, students will deploy and assess computing projects of their own design  with application beyond CS itself  as the courses final capstone. The course continues in the language of Computer Science 5 and especially encourages computing efforts which contribute to fields of interest beyond CS, whether academic or extracurricular.

Raqs Al Sharqi is an introduction to a non-western tradition of dance improvisation, generated in a social dance context, but stylized and expanded to become a stage form primarily in Egypt and Lebanon throughout the 20th century.  The less stylized forms are known in Egyptian dance training communities as Raqs Baladi (dance o the homeland - a social form that is sometimes staged), and as Shaabi (which translates to popular dance).  Each of these also are names given to musical styles, and we will use music from these and other styles to train in the Sharqi style.  This class requires no previous dance experience, and is designed to enhance the student's creative and physical awareness, and familiarize you with the basic movement vocabulary used in this dance form, and with the musical forms utilized in performance.  Classroom activities will also include exercises and information on body alignment, muscular development, and effective breathing/relaxation techniques.|#|DANC091  SC|^|Raqs Al Sharqi I|^|SDAN|^||^|SC|^|Raqs Al Sharqi I - (Egyptian Style Belly Dance)

Through readings we will address questions that histories of colonialism and concerns around the performance of race, gender, and sexuality bring to the global spaces of performance and circulation of these dance forms. Readings draw from Dance Studies, Anthropology, Post-Colonial/Decolonial Studies,Dance Ethnography, and first person acounts written by dancers, complimented by video and sound objects. We will investigate the concepts of Orientalism, authenticity, transnational feminisms, innovation in dance, Western vs. Eastern understandings of virtuosity in movement, cultural appropriation, sexuality and gender in dance, and the politics of representation through dance. The course will be 70% reading/writing; 30% movement/practice.

In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.

|#|DANC139  PO|^|Dance, Ethnicity, Nationalism|^|PTHD|^||^|PO|^|In the United States, and generally in Western Europe, most individuals think of dance in three ways: 1.  A social activity such as a school dance or dancing in a club, 2. A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like "Dancing with the Stars," or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes.|#|DANC140  PO|^|Beg Creative Movmnt Exploration|^|PTHD|^||^|PO|^|Composition I.

Texts exemplifying feminist ethnographic methods in dance and performance studies explore intercontinental connections through media, geography, and collective aesthetic and political impulses. The ethnographies we read, focused on performance broadly construed, represent feminist research concerns and methodologies of women of color.  Additionally, through case studies we approach topics addressed by feminist artists in their work (blackness, passing, environmental concerns, sexual violence, lesbian identity, immigration, disability, among others). We will train in feminist theory and methods in critical performance ethnography, and engage in thoughtful performance making and criticism. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing.

Students analyze a form of cognitive bias known as âPlant Blindnessâ or the human tendency to overlook or marginalize plants, which may affect policy making and environmental design decisions, and contribute to the systematic loss of biodiversity and cultural connections with plants. Students develop floristic relationships through field-based creative exercises in and around the Claremont Colleges. At the end of the course students propose active solutions for appreciating the value of the botanical world. |#|EA  039  PZ|^|Introduction to Food Systems|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|Food is unique among all products created, bought, sold, traded, shipped, and consumed: we are what we eat after all. Food
connects us to one another, to our families, cultures, and histories. It is a major part of our economy - every day of our lives is
impacted by food system workers. Today, the increased availability of cheaper food, larger portion sizes, the reliance on high calorie,
processed ingredients, the types of food available in many communities, government policies, and lifestyle choices have led to an
epidemic of food-related health problems. At the same time, many Americans struggle with food insecurity due to wage stagnation
and economic disruptions. Food systems are both major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly vulnerable to
climate change. The sustainability of human civilization hinges on the resilience of our food systems. In this course, we develop an indepth understanding of food systems - the people, processes, and resources that move our food from farm and ocean to plate.
Students learn how to analyze food system issues, from food production and distribution to food insecurity and public policy.|#|EA  045  PZ|^|Mullholland Drive to Montclair|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|Mullholland Drive to Montclair: The Origins and Legacies of a Southern California Metropolis

Cliches and stereotypes abound when discussing Los Angeles: a dystopian city with neither a center nor a soul, an accidental metropolis connecting disparate suburbs in the desert. In reality, Los Angeles was a meticulously planned urban experiment, one rooted in white supremacy and unfettered capitalism. Ironically, the failed US city of popular imagination now stands as a laboratory on how to retrofit a city and render it functional â an experiment beset with huge challenges â climate change, gentrification, homelessness etc. We will read seminal critiques of the city: Reynard Banhamâs Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies., Mike Davisâ City of Quartz and Ecology of Fear, and more contemporary critics including Pitzerâs own Susan Philipsâ The City Beneath: A Century of Los Angeles Graffiti, LA Times columnist Gustavo Arellano and former architecture critic, Christopher Hawthorne.

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities.

GIS|^|PEVA|^||^|PO|^|Maps have the power to reveal relationships that are not readily seen, such as uneven impacts of COVID-19, global climate change, environmental pollution, and so on. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions.  In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equity.

We begin by reviewing the hydrologic cycle and discussing the physical processes that occur in headwater streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Early seminars introduce the chemical processes and 'signatures' of headwaters and gaining surface waters. The course is structured to focus on different types of systems separately, e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and estuaries while demonstrating that many of the same ecological processes and phenomena occur in each, i.e., biogeochemical cycling, controls on primary production, evolutionary selection, community patterns, population dynamics and food web structure. The most visible taxa in aquatic systems will be introduced including algae, plants, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles via laboratory and field work. The course will discuss how drinking, irrigation, recreation, transportation, flood control and power generation compete for water resources, altering the ecology of inlands ecosystems. Case studies will integrate ecological sub-disciplines while highlighting the human-nature conflicts in freshwater systems. Students interested in watershed and marine systems will find the course extremely useful in their understanding of how various biota co-exist in these seemingly simple systems. There will be two weekend field trips for the course. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: BIOL041E PO or EA 030  PO plus one lab course or CHEM001B PO or one semester of statistics.

Have you ever wondered how health insurance works and why Health Insurance is a good thing but why so many people are uninsured or what happens when someone cannot afford health insurance? Have you ever wondered why there are so many disparities in health by race and income or why health is better when the economy is flourishing than in a recession? Did you know that African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos are more likely to die from COVID-19 than individuals who are white? Have you wondered why that may be and what can be done about it? Have you ever wondered whether economics might provide insights into how to address the number of people with behavioral health or mental health issues? Have you wondered what is being done to address those individuals whose mental health has deteriorated due to COVID-19? Have you ever wondered whether economics could be used to reduce the number of people who smoke and vape and thus threaten the health of themselves and others?? Have you ever wondered why there was a shortage or providers to treat various conditions or why doctors and hospitals have been devastated financially due to COVID-19 and may close?This course will explain how fundamental economic concepts such as supply, demand, monopoly and market power, risk and insurance, substitutes and complements, externalities, taxation and cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, can be used to better understand and solve some of these huge and devastating health issues in our society.

The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting). The course will not discuss politics institution by institution. Instead, the objective of this course is to develop some habits of mind that enable the students see the world of politics through the analytical lens of economics.

Microeconomic models are used to analyze individual and household decisions regarding demographic behavior, including fertility, marriage and family organization, human capital investment (health and education), migration, and labor force behavior, as well as many factors that influence or are otherwise related to these outcomes.  We will examine causes and consequences of changes in human populations (e.g., size, age structure, gender balance, health, wealth) using an economic framework. Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity.  Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level.  We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets.  Basic techniques of demographic measurement and mathematical demography are covered, with emphasis on hands-on analysis and presentation of demographic and economic data. Letter grade only.

Through explorations of the narrative arts and storytelling focusing on the theme of
global mass migration, this class will incite students to imagine, motivate, and enact
social justice. How does narrative construct and make sense of the world? How might we
deploy the power of the narrative arts to infuse justice in our everyday world? How can
we connect subjective lived experiences and our digital identities? In this moment, when
selfhood is constructed by algorithms and history is driven by market data, how might we
harness the knowledges, technologies, and traditions of the narrative arts to rage against
the machine?|#|ENGL010  PO|^|Introduction to Close Reading|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as "close reading."  Close reading begins, not with the question, "What do these words mean?" but instead, the question, "What do these words say?"  And then, "What if these words mean just what they say?"  And then, "What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J.

Mind is what is awake to reality. What is reality? That's the question.

In this course we will consider how the gothic genre made its way into the writing of numerous 19th century American authors, such as Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edith Wharton, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Moreover, we will consider how the history of slavery and indigenous removal influenced the formulation of American gothic tropes, such as the shadow, the haunted house, psychological turmoil, and fear of the unknown. Finally, we will read from contemporary African American authors such as Toni Morrison and Octavia Butler, whose neo-gothic texts reimagine what haunts American literature.

Making uncommon demands, they raise the risk/reward quotient for their readers (and, obviously, their authors as well), and exchange the usual consolations of fiction for the possibility of plunging the reader into an unforgettable experience, even as they beg to go unread or at least unfinished.

This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one "body" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few)  across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of "affordance" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the "vivid" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.|#|ENGL064A PO|^|Creative Writing: Fiction|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Elements of Creative Writing.

Touching down at key moments in the development of the imagined and actual West, we investigate a variety of supplementary discourses fueling nineteenth-century westward expansion and settlement (e.g. empire for liberty, manifest destiny, gold rush) and their perpetuation and evolution in the twentieth century (e.g. closing of the frontier, Hollywood, Route 66). Texts range from the travel narratives of Lewis and Clark and Mark Twain to the social protests of John Rollin Ridge and Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton to the modernist experiments of Nathanael West, Joan Didion, and Don DeLillo. Through this broad survey of western American literature, students encounter a variety of voices competing over the symbolic and the manifest representation of a highly coveted territorial space.

In addition to selections from Freud, weâll read Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, Shirley Jackson, and Flannery OâConnor, and watch contemporary Queer and Black Gothic cinema and television.

Weâll use critical thought from Gloria AnzaldÃºa and others as guides in understanding the border as a psychic, social, and cultural terrain with its own unique pensamiento fronterizo [border thought].

This world literature course will survey global Anglophone fiction, with a focus on coming-of-age stories. We will study the genre of the bildungsroman (German for novel of education or novel of formation) in postcolonial fiction, with attention to the ways the genre is adapted or modified, and we will assess the utility of child narrators to comment on socioeconomic conditions and historical events. We will analyze childhood as a historically-contingent category, and we consider the ways that postcolonial contextsincluding economic, historical, cultural dimensionsshape the development and integration of the individual protagonists of these formation texts.|#|ENGL099  PO|^|The Idea of the Renaissance|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The term "Renaissance" is largely taken to identify a period of radical innovation in humanist arts and letters, one that begins with the rediscovery of old, lost, forgotten, and discarded things. Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project?  What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an  "unfinished event?" The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.|#|ENGL099  PZ|^|Desire & Love in Mod & Cont Lit|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Desire and Love in Modern and Contemporary Literature

Both partaking of and radically departing from the morefamiliar genres of epic, tragedy, and comedy, early modern "romance" has been described as the'kitchen sink' of literature (e.g. anything, everything goes) and it has been decried as a dangerouswaste of time. What would it mean to think of "romance" as a mode or instrument of inquiry, a tool of epistemology, a form or set of forms with which writers and readers of the early modern period came to know the world as it was, as it might be, and as it should be?

We will consider the influence of both classical and early modern revenge tragedy on Shakespeare, exploring the issues of governance and inheritance that are at the heart of his most famous works. We will also attend to the complex motivations of the protagonists who give these plays their names. In turning to the romances, we will consider how style and subject matter (as well as chronology) mark these late plays: should we read them as tragedies gone wrong-or gone right?|#|ENGL112  SC|^|Shakespeare:Tragedies & Romances|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course focuses on Shakespeare's four major tragedies and on the four plays now known as the "romances".

At the heart of the course is "Paradise Lost," the epic poem for which Milton is most famous and whose influence is perceptible across and beyond the Western literary canon. Alongside this we will consider Milton's early lyric and late dramatic poetry and the sources that shaped it, as well as examples of his polemical prose writing on subjects ranging from divorce to the freedom of the press. Our discussions will explore Milton's literary engagements with such issues as political tyranny, the status and rights of women, scientific innovation, human agency and ree will, and the role of petry itself in a rapidly changing world.

By considering famous Shakespearean "others" such as Shylock and Othello alongside authors who themselves lived marginalized or precarious lives, we will explore how different literary genres could both provide a voice to the vulnerable and be used as a weapon against them.|#|ENGL118S SC|^|Rhyme and Reason in Renaissance|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course takes as its focus the growing centrality of literary writing (and specifically poetry) to social, political, and religious commentary in early modern England. We will read texts by authors including Francis Bacon, Margaret Cavendish, John Milton, and George Puttenham with reference to contemporaneous works produced in different geographical (primarily European) locations. Our discussions will consider the role of humanist philosophy and pedagogy in shaping how prominent authors of the period theorized literary writing, and will examine their attempts to use poetry sometimes in making polemical public arguments, and sometimes in retreating from such argumentation altogether. |#|ENGL118S SC|^|Rhyme and Reason in Renaissance|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course takes as its focus the growing centrality of literary writing (and specifically poetry) to social, political, and religious commentary in early modern England.

of ecological crisis? What might it mean to collaborate with the environment in the process of making a poem? Drawing on works of ecopoetry and documentary poetics, we will consider the relations between human and
nonhuman life, the meaning of survival in the midst of climate change, and the connections between place, collective memory, and belonging. Students will compose weekly poems in response to the course topics and
a site-specific project based on creative fieldwork. The course will also include field trips in the surrounding area.
Pre-requisite: one college-level course in creative writing. |#|ENGL120A PO|^|19th Century American Literature|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This class examines nineteenth-century American literature with an emphasis on the theme of passing.

We will explore, and sometimes explode, the myth of normalcy. No body is normal, even to itself. No body is ever one thing, but growing and falling apart in time. When we come to know that our bodies are perforated, what do we gain and what do we lose? How can a poem or a story unravel the contradictions between body, world, and mind, solitude and community, stigma and resistance, poison and cure? How does medical discourse limit how we think [about] the body? Students will respond to course material through creative writing and literary analysis. |#|ENGL130  PZ|^|Adv Projects in Creative Writing|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|This course is intended as a capstone experience for students whose primary focus is creative writing.

|#|ENGL142  PO|^|Literature and The Commons|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|How to Live Together: Literature and the Commons December 1976, philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes watches a mother pulling her young child, who cannot keep up, along a walkway. He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: "she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son's rhythm is different." A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called "How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces." At the heart of the course was Barthes' concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of "individual rhythms" that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes' notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: "spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living." How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we'll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to "content." Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M.|#|ENGL142  SC|^|The Early American Novel|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This seminar explores the development of the novel in the United States before 1850 with particular attention to the early national period. The course will focus on the relationship between the novel and early American political culture, considering how the novel's emergence in the US both shaped and was shaped by contemporary debates about democratic governance. We will consider the rise of the novel in the US in relation to the widespread anxieties about fiction, worries about transgressive sexual behavior, debates about female education, competing theories of national history, discussions of religious difference, and the struggle over slavery. |#|ENGL143S SC|^|Antebellum Lit & Pop Culture|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|The years preceding the Civil War saw both the emergence of a distinctive national literature in the US and the rise of mass consumer culture.

The course will attend to such issues as the emergence of modern social movements, the explosion of writing by and for women, and the popularity of gothic and sensational fiction in the penny press. Readings will encompass both "classic" American literature and the ephemera of antebellum print culture.

We will examine discussions and scholarship regarding Asian American poetry and poetics that have deepened in the last twenty-five years.  In addition, the course will engage with the emergent and established communities that have formed by and for Asian American poets from the mid-twentieth century to the present. This class will also examine and situate the work of Asian American poets as located both inside and outside a mainstream white culture. We will explore the poetry and poetics of Asian American poets from the second half of the twentieth-century to contemporary twenty first-century poetry, particularly following three categories of poetic form: narrative, lyric, and nontraditional writing.  This focus on form will include work off the page, performance, spoken word, and avant-garde work. Not only will the course explore multifaceted traditions in poetry but we will also look at both the theories of categorization and the politics that are always at stake for the poetries and poets. Letter grade only.|#|ENGL146S SC|^|Theory of the American Novel|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course offers a history of the development of the novel genre in the United States. The main focus of the class will be reading significant American novels from the 1790s through the early 20th century. The class will examine how these novels both participated in and were shaped by various social, political, and cultural developments of the long nineteenth century, including(among many others) the contest to define democracy in the early republic, the explosion of writing by and for women in the 1840s and 50s, the antebellum struggles over slavery, and the rise of modern social movements. The class will also consider writing about novels-from both 19th-century writers and later scholars-giving particular attention to accounts of what distinguishes "the American Novel" from other national traditions, especially the English novel. It will also consider the limitations of accounts that understand the development of the novel in such national terms. In addition, this course will offer an introduction to the subfield of 20th and 21st-century literary theory known as "theory of the novel." We will both consider how these theories of the genre illuminate the novels that we are reading and consider the ways in which these grand theories of the novel cannot account for the genre as it developed in the US. This course meets the senior seminar requirement for Scripps English majors (please see "Senior Requirement in the English major" in the catalog) but is open to all students. |#|ENGL147  SC|^|Multi-Ethnic U.S. Lit  1770-1945|^||^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course introduces students to the critical and historical frameworks literary scholars have used to study multi-ethnic literature in early U.S. contexts, especially those related the intersections of race and ethnicity. Readings focus on the eighteenth, nineteenth-, and early-twentieth centuries and include works by U.S. authors of African, Asian, Indigenous, Latinx, and SWANA (Southwest Asian and North African) descent. The course pays particular attention to the various ways literary scholarship has engaged with U.S. writers situated at literal and figurative borderlands and/or writing from hybrid identities.|#|ENGL150  PO|^|Visual Poetics|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore the rich and overlapping ways to read poetry and examine visual, performative, intermedial, artist's and textual poetics. We will examine how the term poetics derives from "poiesis", or "active making," and how both poetry writing and art making create textual and visual phenomenon. We will read 20th and 21st century poetry; we will discuss art works, installations, social practice and community-oriented public work. We will also write poetry, create artist books, visit our local galleries and museums, and meet with poets and artists who collaborate on art projects that push the boundaries of art and text. Prerequisites: either one of ENGL064A PO, ENGL064B PO, ENGL064C PO, ENGL064D PO, ENGL183A PO, or ENGL183B PO.|#|ENGL151  PO|^|Medieval Proof|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|What makes us modern if not our experimental disposition? We demand proof; we conduct experiments; we test everything: nuclear weapons, pregnancy, drugs, IQ, DNA, HIV and everything else. This, we think, distinguishes us from our medieval forebears. Still, what is more characteristic of the Middle Ages than their regimes of proof?--trial by ordeal; the test of a hero in a quest; demonstrations of the number of angels on the head of a pin. The purpose of this seminar is to see what-if any-difference obtains between medieval and modern experiences of verification. Keeping in mind modern and contemporary work on the experimental disposition of modernity (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Latour, Ronell), we will examine the reality probes sent out by literary, juridical, logical, theological, mystical, and scientific texts from the Middle Ages. To be considered: the failed tests of Perceval and Gawain; disputation and demonstration in the medieval university; Anselm's proof for the existence of God; torture; methods for distinguishing genuine revelation from demonic apparition; early scientific experiments; Ramon Llull's logic machines; the trial of Joan of Arc.

His works have influenced Nobel laureates (Japan), as well as contemporary writers, playwrights, essayists and filmmakers internationally who continue to see in his corpus a guide, artistically, stylistically and ideologically.

Bourgeois, every day, dour, realistic. Filled with very-long novels about banks and dinners. And then at the window, Frankenstein's creature; a spectral woman in the garden; a hyena with human hands; a revenant nun; a malevolent vampire. This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women's rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.|#|ENGL160S SC|^|Postwar American Poetry|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course will examine a variety of influential schools of post-1945 American poetry, including (among others) the Beats, the Black Mountain poets, the San Francisco Renaissance, the New York School, the Black Arts Movement, the Confessional poets, and LANGUAGE poetry.

Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, &c--were at the same time brilliant propogandists, creating the aesthetic system by which their works would be enjoyed. They also, along the way, created the first self-concious literary period. In this course we'll read fiction, poetry, and critical prose by the founders of Anglo-American literary modernism, looking at the values it supported as well as those it occluded--the voices it supported and those it made much more difficult to hear. Prerequisite: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL170B PO|^|Five American Writers|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The social sciences have an account of art. What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology 'the folklore of white supremacy.' Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, 'desirable things' that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler's words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a 'type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.' Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences.

But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life.

We'll investigate how women negotiated these conventions within conversion narratives, captivity narratives, novels, autobiography, and essays. We'll learn about the methodologies and theoretical frameworks literary scholars use think intersectionally about how gender and power operate in these texts. And we'll examine how contemporary writers - including non-binary and gender-nonconforming writers - have grappled with this literary history and sought to represent those who couldn't, or chose not to, write their stories down.

How did the Cold War and the specter of Communism, and domestic social movements such as the civil rights movement, the New Left, and feminism affect literary history (and vice versa)? How did the formal techniques of modernism give way to postmodernism, and what role did the growth of universities and the rise of creative writing programs play in this process?

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a 'nonfiction novel' in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of 'autofiction')? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel's tradition, given the form's historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact? Assigned authors may include Madeleine de Scudéry, Daniel Defoe, Marcel Proust, Ka-tzetnik 135633, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Michael Herr, Ryszard Kapuciñski, Danilo Kis, W.G. Sebald, Janet Malcolm, Ben Lerner, Rachel Cusk, Sheila Heti, Elif Batuman, and Teju Cole.|#|ENGL189H PO|^|Abraham and Paul|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Abraham and Paul.

Here, "queer" describes strange, odd, or uncanny film/video content. It also refers to racial, gender, and sexual representations that diverge from heterosexual, patriarchal, and national representational norms. We attend to strategies filmmakers use to code non-normative depictions despite filmmaking prohibitions. We also consider the role film/video play in facilitating and challenging the late twentieth-century globalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities. In turn, we develop queer methodologies-reading practices and materialist analyses-to understand how film/video shape and intercept social norms, economic imperatives, and institutions of power. |#|FGSS188B SC|^|Adv Top: Queer Rep Film & Video|^|SFGS|^|05.0207|^|SC|^|This course examines queer representations that intervene into film/video production and consumption.

It attends to how the hemisperic Americas and Asia Pacific regions have been shaped by the United States and China, respectively and concomitantly. We trace overlapping histories of U.S.-European interventions into Asia Pacific, Pacific militarizations, Chinese empire, and modern Chinese nation-state building led by Han ethnonationalisms. Focusing on transpacific crossings and the production of "sinophone cultures" in history, popular culture, science, and tourism, this course applies queer analyses to investigate how the U.S. and China produce one another as analogous "others."

This course follows a transhistorical path, from the creation of the building in the twelfth century (April 1163) until the recent fire (April 15, 2019), and the beginning of the process of renovation. Why is this cathedral important for French identity? To answer this question, we will read and analyze historical texts, look at the literature (novels, opera, poems etc.) that take Notre-Dame as its main topic, and discuss paintings, sculpture, and architecture as well as photography.  Focusing on more recent and contemporary issues having to do with Notre-Dame (from its Napoleonic re-birth, to its Macronic re-construction), the course will also question the place of religions in France, as well as questions of politics and economics. Multimedia and trans-disciplinary, this course will ground you in centuries of French history and culture while giving you insights into France today. Letter grade only.

To understand these developments, we will explore: recent industrial dislocations; immigration in the postwar period; the legacy of French colonialism; Islam in France; the "banlieues" as a site of contestation; the recent refugee crisis; Charlie-Hebdo and other recent terrorist attacks and their aftermaths.

Three questions guide our readings and discussions: "Can religion be laughed at?" "How and why is sex and sexual violence discussed in public?" "Can theater change, or merely reflect ideas?" Our purpose is not to find definitive answers, but to understand and critically assess how texts grapple with these questions in the eighteenth century and today. Readings will include Diderot, Gouges, Rousseau, Voltaire, and a range of current texts, from press articles to scholarly essays.|#|FREN114  SC|^|Reality Matters|^|SFR|^||^|SC|^|Nonfiction cinema does not simply represent our historical world.

Using French and Francophone films as examples, this course will explore the diversity of ways in which, since its inception in 1895 and the Lumiere brothers' 50 second films, "le cinema du reel" has not ceased to reinvent itself, becoming today one of the most protean forms of cultural intervention. Taught in French.|#|FREN116  SC|^|Display, Desire & Domination|^|SFR|^|05.0124|^|SC|^|Display, Desire and Domination ("Se Faire Connaitre en Image") allows students to study and analyze imagery from Francophone contexts related to groups traditionally targeted for their gender, sexuality, race and class.

Even though early precursors like Guy-BlachÃ©, were often erased from film history, women directors in France have a long tradition to draw from. It is this tradition of women filmmaking that we will explore in this course, focusing in particular on a new generation of women directors who today are revitalizing contemporary French cinema. Directors studied include: Guy, Dulac, Epstein, Varda, Akerman, Denis, Palcy, Sciamma, MaÃ¯wenn, Benguigui, Braillat, Ducournau. This course introduces students to the art of cinema, its language and techniques, as well as to film analysis. Taught in French with weekly screenings. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent required.

Some are diaries or autobiographical accounts while others are works of fiction published long after the end of the war. All are concerned with how memory and the self are written and, taken together, they constitute an informal archive standing against oblivion. This course is designed around the exhibition "Hélène Berr, A Stolen Life," to be held at the Scripps Clark Humanities Museum, and a significant portion of the course will be spent studying French survivors' audiovisual testimonies. We will be asking what testimonies, in all their forms, do to literature and how literature interacts with other sources. Special attention will be given to accounts given by women and they will be read in contrast with accounts written about women.|#|FREN129  PO|^|Who's Afraid of Marcel Proust?|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Who's afraid of Marcel Proust?

A decade ago, a group of students at the University of Chicago founded The Point, a new journal dedicated to robust and open conversation about contemporary political and social theory.   Since then The Point has proved a remarkable guide to the at times unsettling dynamics that underlie everyday life in America.  It 
provides perhaps the best collective account of the political meaning of The Teens â the decade of both Barack Obama and Donald Trump â and offers vibrant ways to understand our political present.

We will explore how ideas about the past have shaped the present, including conceptions of race, slavery, and colonialism and 
the notion of the âWest.â We will look at filters through which we see the ancient world, ranging from the Greeks and Romans themselves to Islamic scholars, medieval kings, the writers of the US constitution, several dictators, modern 
artists, and Hollywood filmmakers (among others).  |#|FS  004  PZ|^|Tongue-in-cheek: Humor in Art|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Tongue-in-cheek: Humor in Arts and Visual Culture

communicate contradictory statements simultaneously. Humor has the ability to make something inaccessible, accessible or open up a taboo subject for discussion. In some cases humor is a political gesture. In this course we will 
examine humor through a critical interdisciplinary and intercultural lens. You will be responsible for developing written responses, critiques, oral presentations, performative projects, art and research. |#|FS  005  PZ|^|People on the Move|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|People on the Move: Understanding U.S. Immigration

For the dreamer, dreams can be fantastic and illogical, filled with images of oneâs life often colored with strong emotions and feelings.  We will examine whether the meaning and nature of dreams can be explained and understood according the principles of science and rational thought. Lectures, readings and class discussions will explore a number of different perspectives 
on the nature of dreams and dreaming. We will also look at how dreams are represented in our society through art, music and film and whether or not dream states can be artificially induced through drugs or brain machine interfaces. |#|FS  007  PZ|^|The Last Laugh|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|The Last Laugh: Gender and Stand-up Comedy

In this seminar weâll look at how stand-up comedians use their routines to present different views about gender. We will
use tools from linguistics to examine not only what these performers say but also how they say it. What messages are
comedians sending about masculinity and femininity? How do women of color challenge stereotypes with their
performances? What do queer comedians add to the conversation? We will also look at the pluses and minuses of studying
the media using quantitative versus qualitative methods. 
|#|FS  008  PZ|^|Speculative Feminisms|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Speculative Feminisms and Sustainable Futures

The future is female, proclaims a well-worn feminist adage. Emerging from a circle of radical lesbian intellectuals in 1970s
New York City, the statement operates simultaneously as incantation and prediction, synthesizing the voices of all who
utter it into something generative, rather than simply descriptive. Yet, it reverberates somewhat dissonantly in our contemporary moment; even the term âfemaleâ can evoke the same essentializing tendencies that queer and intersectional feminisms today actively unsettle. Drawing on a range of recent fictional, critical, and localized knowledges, this seminar invites additional speculative futures, exploring interdisciplinary thinking and writing as generative practices.|#|FS  009  PZ|^|Selective Science|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|From Climate Change to Vaccines to Frankenfood we are bombarded in our daily lives with scientific (and 
pseudoscientific) information. How do people use this information.  Why do some accept the science on evolution but not vaccines?  Or on climate change but not GMOs?  The goal of this seminar is to explore how we use science in our daily 
lives.  We will focus on three central questions: How is scientific knowledge generated?  How do people assess and assimilate scientific information in their of daily decision making? How accurately are scientific controversies presented 
in the media? No prior science experience necessary. |#|FS  010  PZ|^|Social Identity|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|There are many aspects that comprise our social identity - age, gender, race/ethnicity, school affiliation, religion, the list 
goes on and on. According to psychologists, these social identities shape the way we navigate our world, such as how we 
categorize ourselves and others, and who we tend to compare ourselves to. Social identity informs us of who constitutes 
our âingroupâ and who constitutes the âoutgroup,â with implications for stereotyping and intergroup prejudice. In this course, we will examine how social identities shape our perception of the world and the consequences for affect, cognition, and behavior.
|#|FS  011  PZ|^|Environmental Documentaries|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Environmental Documentaries: Social Justice and the Environment

This course introduces students to current national and international environmental and social justice issues by exploring how they are documented in film. We examine these documentaries not just as a way of exploring environmental problems but also as vehicles for understanding how arguments are made, how audiences are persuaded, and how evidence is used to justify various theses and assertions. This year the main themes in this course will be climate change; petroleum exploitation and its environmental and social impacts; human encroachment on disappearing habitat; and perspectives on wildlife.|#|FS  012  PZ|^|Pandemic Histories|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Pandemic Histories: Europe During and After the Black Death

In 1347, the Black Death reached Mediterranean Europe and, within a few years, killed over half of Europeâs population. What were important impacts of the pandemic? How did people respond to the experience? By
1351, Giovanni Boccaccio had written a wildly popular fictional work â the Decameron (Ten Days) - in which 10 young women and men shelter in the countryside and pass the time by telling stories filled with humor, sex, violence, deceit, virtue, or pathos. To explore the pandemicâs impacts, weâll read the Decameron in conjunction with historical investigations of the Black Deathâs social and cultural consequences. |#|FS  013  PZ|^|The Musical Mind|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Writing about music can illuminate philosophical questions about the arts, the mind, and aesthetic experience: What defines music - and musicality? How is music biologically grounded and yet also culturally and historically
contingent? What are the relationships between music and language, emotion, and movement? This interdisciplinary
seminar will also explore how scholars across the humanities, social and behavioral sciences, and natural sciences approach the phenomena they wish to explain. Students will practice developing well-reasoned arguments and defending them with appropriate evidence. Through the microcosm of music, we will seek to become analytical readers, elegant writers, clear speakers, and generous listeners.
|#|FS  014  PZ|^|Anti(Racism) and Emotion|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|"Facts and Evidence Don't Work Here": Anti(Racism) and Emotion

In this course, we will explore how emotion impacts how and why people participate in racism and engage in anti-racism in the United States through an interdisciplinary lens. In doing so, students will reflect upon their own positionality, to contextualize their own experiences in U.S. society, begin to see how all our fates are linked. Students will engage in their learning in a variety of ways including in-class writing, research papers, and peer-review and student presentations. 
|#|FS  015  PZ|^|Landscape Matters|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines changes in the environment through multiple lenses of land and landscape and the broad bandwidth of writing about the earth. As half of the terrestrial earth has been transformed for human purposes, 
landscape has become a diversely composite index of human life, a complex inscription on the earth of civilizationâs values.  Students will be encouraged to find their own land and landscape voices as they are also exposed to the ways in 
which others have written about their inquiries into the everyday and extraordinary relationship we have the realm of earthly life. |#|FS  016  PZ|^|Criminalization of Immigrants|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^| How did immigration and the U.S. - Mexico border transform from a low - priority policy issue into one of the most contentious issues in the 20th Century? One of the most important factors shaping the size and composition of 
authorized and unauthorized immigration is U.S. immigration policy. Indeed, to meet labor demands, U.S. immigration 
policy initially encouraged immigration from Mexico and other parts of the globe. Although labor demands continued, 
by the latter part of the 20th Century, some elites saw a political opportunity by constructing immigrants as a threat and 
the U.S.âMexico border as dangerous. A major focus of this course examines the process that has led to the criminalization of immigrants and the militarization of the U.S.âMexico border. 
|#|FS  017  PZ|^|Psychology of Cricket|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Associated in the popular imagination with Britain and its former colonies and sometimes baffling to Americans, the 
2019 Cricket World Cup was watched by an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide.  This course will introduce students 
to important psychological concepts in sports psychology and apply those concepts to cricket. We will explore the socioâhistorical evolution of international cricket.  Second, students will be introduced to various intraâ and interâpersonal psychological processes related to sport.|#|FS  018  PZ|^|La Familia|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|This seminar will explore the role of âla familiaâ (the family) for Latinx people living in the U.S. We will analyze both commonalities and differences across conceptions and constructions of la familia. We will also examine la familia from a
comparative perspective (contemporary, across different Latinx groups, within families, across immigration status, etc.),
and will consider the psychological, sociocultural, and political factors that contribute to the complexity and diversity of Latinx families. Students will read research and narrative accounts of the journeys that Latinx families have undertaken (in some cases, crossing the U.S./Mexico border and being separated from family members) resulting in the development of transnational ties and evolving identities. |#|FS  019  PZ|^|Radical Care|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|We are in the midst of a global âcrisis of care.â The growing inequalities produced by late capitalism have disrupted our 
social capacities for everything from birthing and raising children to caring for friends and family to maintaining households and communities. And yet such reproductive labor is essential for the creation and maintenance of social bonds and the functioning of institutions and infrastructures. How are artists and activists pushing back against this 
crisis, forging collective movements that view âcareâ for oneâs self and oneâs community as moral imperatives to act? 
How might the expression of radical care - in literature, activism, and art - call into being more socially just relations 
among friends, family, neighborhoods, and communities? 
|#|FS  020  PZ|^|In the News|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|This course's main goal is for students to learn how to stay well informed about news in the world in which they live.  That will involve both using various sources to follow the news and examining the history and shifting politicalâ
economy of journalism, particularly in the context of the internet.  A core assignment will be to read each dayâs New York Times online, but this will be supplemented by a range of local, national, and global news sources, as well as relevant scholarly literature.  |#|FS  021  PZ|^|The Future|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|What do different thinkers believe the future will bring, and what is basis of those predictions? We will assess social science research, fiction, and one or more movies about such topics as the future of work, economic inequality, education, moral decision making, state surveillance, the climate, and social effects of technological change. In addition to
sharpening your writing, research, and critical analysis skills, the course will introduce you to disciplinary differences in
research and writing as we compare articles by philosophers, anthropologists, economists, historians, and cultural critics,
among others.  |#|FS  022  PZ|^|Drug Development|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Drug Development, Policy and Innovation

This seminar provides students with an inâdepth perspective into the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the process by 
which a drug candidate transitions from the laboratory to patient. Discussions will also focus on public policy and ethical 
debates surrounding the pharmaceutical industry and the commercialization of science. Topics include: the link between 
academic research and industry, the clinical trial process by which a molecule becomes a drug, the origin and role of the FDA  in  protecting  the  consumer,  the  concept  of  informed  consent  in  ethical  drug  development,  and  the  economics associated with orphan drug development.  |#|FS  023  PZ|^|Graphic Fiction and Narrative|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Graphic narratives have long been historical artifacts, from Lascaux cave paintings to the Bayeux Tapestry, demonstrating that illustrative storytelling has been a human activity for millennia. From the 1970s onward,what is now generally called a graphic novel has continued to develop; film, television, and theatrical versions have sprung from what are still often referred to as comic books. Yet the serious subject matter of this output has become an active and important part of visual art and commentary, as seen in Safe Area GoraÅ¾de by Joe Sacco, Unterzakhan by
Leela Corman, and Drawings from the Gulag by Danzig Baldaev. In this course students will examine, explore, and articulate their ideas through both text and imagery that addresses serious contemporary and/or historical subjects.
Assigned readings and research will be accompanied by substantial drawing and illustration training.|#|FS  024  PZ|^|Diversity, Equity & Inequities|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|This course will examine questions surrounding ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality and consider how this diversity has been challenged or accepted in the United States. Students will analyze contemporary and historical issues and explore questions of social justice as they read a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts. In discussions and compositions, students will consider the ways that culture and social structures shape the Pitzer experience, as well as imagining their own roles in transforming society. This course is the designated First-Year Seminar for students in the International Scholars Program and is open to non-native English speakers only. |#|FWS 010  CM|^|Freshman Writing Seminar|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|The Freshman Writing Seminar Program, directed by the Department of Literature, aims to enhance the writing skills and literary acumen of first-year students through intensive composition and revision and the study of significant texts and models.

|#|GEOG105  HM|^|Place, Power, and Difference|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course introduces students to social and cultural approaches to space and spatiality. It explores how cultural geography can open up understandings of race, class, gender, sexuality, and other modes of social difference and power. The course critically engages a number of key concepts  space, place, scale,intersectionality, performativity, and orientalism - in leading intellectual debates about place, power, and difference. It will help students develop an awareness of how processes of identity and community formation are inherently spatial, and the significance of the work of social and cultural cultural geographers to political and intellectual struggles around difference.

|#|GEOG175  HM|^|Geographies of Labor|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|What is work? How is work socially and spatially organized? How are these forms of spatial organization struggled over and transformed? Who performs what kind of work? Where? Why? This course introduces students to some of the leading critical approaches to the geographies of labor, including Marxist political economy and feminist, critical-race, anticolonial and queer theories. This course investigates a number of contemporary shifts in the organization of work, including the rise of neoliberalism, deindustrialization, the feminization of the paid labor force, the prevalence of precarious work, contemporary forms of labor migration, and the expansion of prison labor. Locating these shifts in the longer histories and geographies of unfree labor, students will examine some of the ways in which workers have used their labor as a departure point for collective action, including unionization, work refusals, and struggles over social reproduction.|#|GEOG179D HM|^|Geographies of Solidarity|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|The figure of "community" is invoked by a wide range of social and political actors as self-explanatory and uncontroversially good. This seminar-style course will investigate the contradictory potential of community as both a departure point for emancipatory social transformation, and a site of exclusion, fraught group bonding, and cooptation by the political-economic status quo. Course readings will traverse feminist, antiracist, queer, political-economic, psychoanalytic, and poststructuralist theories that reflect on the limitations and powers of community; ethnographic reflections on the ethics of life within communities; and activist and organizer perspectives. Course assignments will emphasize the value of self-reflexivity, humility, and intellectual rigor in the never-ending work of making sense of lived experiences in community.|#|GEOG179G HM|^|Political Ecologies|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|What problems does an economic system based on profit accumulation pose for life on planet Earth? How do systems of domination such as white supremacy, colonialism, and heteropatriarchy facilitate the exploitation of land, people, and non-human animals?

The course will explore the relevance of these ideas to historical questions and contemporary debates about law, order, and justice within urban communities in the United States, including mass incarceration, police brutality, and abolition.

Prerequisite: GOVT020 CM|#|GOVT182  CM|^|Church/State in US Constitution|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|Over two hundred years into the American experiment, issues of church and state continue to divide the nation. How far reaching is "the great separation" between church and state? Does it require the development of a secular citizenry? Is it consistent with claims that America is a Christian nation? The vexed relationship between church and state is at the heart of public debates regarding education, marriage, and numerous other issues. To illuminate current debates we will examine the philosophical and political arguments for separation and how these have played out over the course of American constitutional history. Prerequisite Government 20.

No prior knowledge of German required but appropriate for all levels of German proficiency. Taught in English.|#|GRMT102  SC|^|Manifestos|^|SGRM|^||^|SC|^|Manifestos: Poetry of the Revolution
As consumers of modern culture's artifacts-paintings, architecture, movies, literature-we tend to be unaware that most artistic and political movements originated in one very specific idea. Em-bodying the quintessentially modern claim to nothing less than the capacity to change the world, the manifesto has captured the urgency of this idea for almost 200 years.
Beginning with the modern era's archetypical manifesteers, Marx and Engels, this class explores proclamations by the abolitionist movement, Italian Futurists, and Riot Grrrl punk rockers. We will discuss declarations by womenâs suffrage activists, Bauhaus architects, the Chicanx Student Movement, Soviet filmmakers, and many other manifestos.  Taught in English.|#|GRMT103H SC|^|Karl Marx: Capital|^|SGRM|^||^|SC|^|This conversation class offers a guided close reading of volume I of Karl Marx? magnum opus Capital: A Critique of Political Economy (1867).

We explore two related (but distinct) topics: how crimes are planned and executed; and how they are then turned, step-by-step, into compelling literary and cinematic storylines. Course and materials are entirely in English.|#|GRMT116  SC|^|The Decadents|^|SGRM|^|16.0501|^|SC|^|The 19th century "decadents" treated art as an intoxicant. Theirs was a cult of extremes: theaters of cruelty, art for art's sake, celebrations of criminality, and deliberate derangement of the senses. Course begins with 19th-century fiction, visual arts and criticism, and then turns to their "after-images" among 20th-century avant-gardes.  |#|GRMT119  SC|^|Modern Times|^|SGRM|^|16.0501|^|SC|^|In the years that followed World War I, Europe experienced an extraordinary degree of both social upheaval and creative experimentation. Expressionist violence, stream of consciousness narrative, fractured imagery: writers used whatever means they could to come to terms with the period's rapid-fire modernization.

Why do we work? How do we work? Where and when do we work? Who works? and who has leisure? The course privileges somewhat European and German ideas (Marx, Weber, socialist class and gender concepts of work) but is open to broader comparative and global contributions. It addresses issues of labor, the large-scale social and economic organization of work for an industry or a nation, as well as the psychological, emotional, individual dimension of identity, self-worth, and one's social standing.|#|GRMT167  SC|^|Metropolis: Imagining the City|^|SGRM|^||^|SC|^|Whether pictured as labyrinth, stage set, utopian pleasure-dome or gigantic living room, the urban landscape has played a crucial role in the attempt of 20th-century writers and artists to come to terms with modernity. The course will move from the squares of 19th-century Berlin, the grid of Manhattan, to the malls and theme parks of Los Angeles, using fiction (Poe, Kafka, Wm. Gibson), film (Lang, Wenders, R. Scott), essays (Eco, Didion), and urban theory (Sennett, Choay) to investigate how changes in the perception of the city reflect the ways modernity sees itself.

Based on a blend of sources, this cultural-studies course provides a survey of the current state of race relations and racial discourse in the German-speaking countries. It draws on input from literary texts, discussions in media, presentations in film and other visuals, and experiences in daily life. A key goal of the course is, beyond the broad content focus on questions of race, migration, xenophobia, class, and DEI, to offer an alternative view of these topics beyond the US-American debate. Many students are doubtlessly already acquainted with the latter, and the course provides a new lens on these questions through the cultural historical parameters of a different country/culture.

Racial capitalism as a framework recognizes that capitalism is inherently social and that capitalist value production has thrived on the violent and violative production of social and spatial difference and separability. We will learn from interdisciplinary scholars that have asked and investigated how and where categories of difference like race, class, gender, and sexuality are in productive tension with the relations of property, ownership, and capitalist value. We will learn about abolition democracy as a political intellectual model that precedes and exceeds the developmental model of racial capitalism by grounding abolition democracy within Black and Indigenous studies and Gender and Sexuality studies. Abolition democracy is not just a response to racial capitalism and racist violence, but is a way of being and knowing that offers insights to some of our most pressing social concerns.|#|GWS 140  PO|^|Queer Of Color Lit And Theory|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This class will examine the central texts of queer of color (Black, Latinx, Asian American and others) theory, while also studying the novels, poetry and plays of important authors.

In doing so, we examine the queer and crip children and childhoods against which the figure of the Child is articulated. This course draws on work in gender studies, childhood studies, disability studies, and queer theory, including Julian Gill-Peterson, Alison Kafer, Lee Edelman, and Katherine Boyd Stockton.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?|#|GWS 162  PO|^|Decolonizing Gender/Sex Asian/Am|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|Through an analysis of historical and contemporary Asian American and Pacific Islander literature, film, performance, art, and popular culture, this course emphasizes a wide range of engagements with gender and sexuality that disrupts binary thinking on the topic.

In particular, the intersectional dimensions of disability will be stressed, as the category has played a key role in the production and organization of gender, race, sexuality, class and religion. The second part of the course will give an introduction to some of the major directions and shifts within the field, such as the transgendered body & medicalization, invisible disabilities, transnationalism, animal studies, new materialisms and technology/media.

Another goal of the class is to question how contemporary approaches to environmentalism might have arisen out of already limited epistemological frameworks and legal histories. As part of our investigation into the asymmetrical distribution of toxins and environmental fallout across different populations, students will not only grapple with biopolitical theory but also look to a range of cultural texts - from science fiction films to contemporary fiction to graphic art - to consider alternative political assemblages and strategies for survival that arise from gender and ethnic studies frameworks.

We will examine concepts of identity, sexual practices and queerness in relation to notions of the local-global, nationhood, the transnational, diaspora, borders, margins, and urban-rural. We will bring postcolonial, transnational, queer, and feminist disciplinary approaches to bear upon one another, in order to study how knowledge about sex, gender and sexuality is produced and disseminated transnationally. Prerequisite: GWS 026  PO.  |#|GWS 185  PO|^|Biopolitics: Sex,Captlsm,Affect|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This course will center on the writings of Michel Foucault as well as his interlocutors and successors to ask about the workings of power, discipline and control in the modern era.

This course will examine the multiple modes by which the body has been understood and imagined, drawing primarily from queer, feminist, disability and critical race scholars.  In addition, we will explore the political implications of how the body is theorized. Rather than perpetuating a universalist understanding of the body as ahistorical or demanding an over-determined particularity around the body that neglects forms of relationality, we will seek to balance questions of bodily matter and experience with gestures towards relations to another. We will read scholars such as Hortense Spillers, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault, Susan Stryker, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jean-Luc Nancy, Mel Chen, Bryan Turner and Gilles Deleuze.

Contact and interaction between indigenous Americans, Europeans, and Africans produced fabricated categories of social standing that continue to the present day. The class will explore how colonial regimes worked aggressively to police those racial lines. Yet, we will also consider how relations between and among those groups challenged and altered these racial constructs. This will culminate in an overall discussion on the evolution of modern racial attitudes.

|#|HIST124  PO|^|The U.S. in the Middle East|^|PHST|^||^|PO|^|For over a century the relationship between the United States and several nations of the Middle East was defined by mutual benefit and positive collaboration, especially in the fields of science, healthcare, and education. Whereas the people of the Middle East immediately recognized European powers as colonial invaders, they viewed America in a very positive light. However, the century-long positive perceptions gave way to a more negative and hostile view of the US in the Middle East since the mid-20th century. To understand this radical shift in the relations between the US and the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century. Along the way, we will examine key issues such as America's earliest cultural and educational engagement in the region, Cold War rivalries, oil, US military intervention in the region since the 1950s and its support of authoritarian governments, Arab Nationalisms, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the rise of Islamist Movements.

|#|HIST132  CM|^|Genocide/Hum-Rights 20thC Europe|^|MHIS|^||^|CM|^|During the twentieth century, the totality and modern features of the mass murder of civilians proved so alarming and unprecedented that by mid-century observers, led by Raphael Lemkin, developed a new concept for this historical phenomenon: genocide. This course will focus on case studies of genocide and genocide prevention in Europe. How do border changes, nation-state formation, and the collapse and rise of empires trigger ethnic cleansing and genocide as occurred in the Ottoman Empire, the Second World War, and more recently in the post-Soviet conflicts in the former Yugoslavia? Lectures and discussions will delve into specific topics, such as the role of racism, anti-Semitism and biopolitics, the psychological responses of victims, the inclusion of rape as a genocidal war crime, the response of bystanders, perpetrator motivation, and trends in post-genocidal societies such as trials, memorialization and compensation.

Karl Marx seemed dead and gone in 1990, after the Berlin Wall came down and the world witnessed the socalled end of communism. But the old ghosts are back--Russia on the rise, democracy questioned, inequalities reminiscent of the Gilded Age. One of those ghosts is Karl Marx, who has reappeared to haunt the present. But he wrote in the 19th century, for an audience of a different time and place. So the question arises: what remains relevant from his writings? What do we salvage and what do we discard? Reading him intensively, with an eye to present conundrums, and in concert with Thomas Piketty, we will attempt to answer some of those questions together. |#|HIST133  SC|^|Freud/Derrida|^|SHIS|^|54.0101|^|SC|^|This course will examine key concepts common to Freudian psychoanalysis and Derridean deconstruction: repression and meaning, the limit of knowledge, and sexual difference and the self.

Colombia is home to the second largest Black population in Latin America after Brazil, and Blacks have stood at the heart of its struggles for dignity across the course of the nations history.

Throughout the colonial era (1697 to 1791 in Haiti and the 1520s to 1810 in Colombia), the poor practiced marronage or escape from beneath the control of European slave elites and metropoles. Metaphorically, those who liberate themselves or break free are the maroon nations, the peoples who have built societies based upon egalitarianism and profound respect for the land. Ranged against them were elites closely tied to Europeans, at first, and then to the United States, up to the present.

Black Colombians have won rights to the land that are historic for all people in the African Diaspora in the hemisphere. The Black majority of Haiti has, in recent decades, twice elected a president who obeys the will of the poor, and that sort of political project has encountered the full wrath of foreign soldiers, extractive economic models, and U.S.-backed coups.|#|HIST144  SC|^|Haiti/Colombia/Maroons/Paramilit|^|SHIS|^|54.0101|^|SC|^|This course looks at two countries that are not commonly compared, Haiti and

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.

For Spring 2022:

This course will survey the history of North Africa, including Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and the Sudan, from the mid-19th century to the end of formal colonialism in the mid-20th century, focusing on the various political and social movements that arose in response to colonial rule. Topics will include but are not limited to the Mahdi rebellion in Sudan, the Rif War in Morocco, and the Algerian War for Independence. We will also consider acts of rebellion and resistance that do not always fit the mold of textbook nationalism, and thus are often not engaged with as âanti-colonialism.â In the process, students will learn to think critically about the nature of resistance, the construction of race, nation, and identity, the role of violence, and the significance of culture and knowledge in political struggles. We will also be attentive to global contexts and material and ideological connections between decolonizing movements in North Africa and those in the Middle East (âMashriqâ), sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and beyond.

Restrictions on speech are a feature of democracies everywhere, from persecuting whistleblowers in the US to banning religious symbols in France to imposing restrictions on Twitter in Turkey. What sets the South Asian experience apart? This course will interrogate how a nexus of concerns over power, religion, and sex, originating in the colonial experience, has shaped the particular dynamics of censorship in South Asia. By examining the regionâs long history of banning and prohibition, we will gain insight into how censorship has moulded South Asian cultural and political life. This course welcomes students interested in gender and sexuality studies, cinema and media studies, literature, history, politics, human rights, anthropology, and modern South Asian history and culture, as well as students interested in the past and present of censorship and democracy in the non-West.

crisis. But why and how is history especially relevant now? Is its lesson primarily instructive, to teach us that the past either repeats itself or is constituted by unique events? Does history provide critical distance to help us reflect on the present maelstrom of political rancor and division? Or might its uses even be emotional or psychological, offering comfort and shelter from a harsh contemporary reality?

Today Muslims from different ethnic, political, and social backgrounds constitute over 4 percent of the population of the European Union. The nearly century-long migration of an increasing number of guest workers, professionals, and asylum seekers to countries like Germany, France, Sweden, and Great Britain has established Muslims as a large minority in several EU countries. Yet the growing presence of Muslims in European societies in recent years due to escalating violent conflicts, imperialist intervention, sectarian rifts, and terrorist attacks, triggered heated debates about citizenship, racism, integration and the place of Islam and Muslims in Europe. It also gave rise to a growing right-wing mobilization and anti-Muslim animosity, with surprising similarities to the anti-Semitic propaganda of the past. In this course we will examine questions like this: What are the historical, economic, and political reasons for the migration of the Muslims to Europe? Why are some groups of Muslims in the EU integrated, while others are marginalized? Are Muslims equally represented in European democracies? If not, what are the obstacles that prevent Muslim minorities from participation and institutional access?

|#|HIST197D SC|^|Pandemics and Globalized World|^|SHIS|^||^|SC|^|Contagion! Historical Pandemics and the Globalized World. This class will examine worldwide pandemics through the lens of globalization.  In what ways are pandemics a direct consequence of global exploration and trade?  Where do these diseases start and where do they spread?  But most important: how and why do they spread?  And in what ways does the lived experience of a pandemic influence and become influenced by other social and cultural trends across the globe, particularly in science trends across the globe, particularly in science and religion?  We will consider these questions zooming in on the following case studies: the Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, the Columbian Exchange, multiple outbreaks of Smallpox and Cholera in the 19th century, the Third Plague Pandemic, the 'Spanish' Flu of 1918, Polio, the Asian Flu of 1957, AIDS, and Ebola. |#|HIST197F SC|^|Topics in Historical Study|^|SHIS|^||^|SC|^||#|HIST197G JT|^|Topics in Historical Study|^|SHIS|^||^|SC|^|What else might radicalism mean? How and why did democrats abandon populism to the political right?

The diverse set of readings includes labor leaders, agrarian farmers, artists, religious figures, and civil rights organizers, as well as some major political thinkers.|#|HIST197S AF|^|Haitian Revolution|^|SHIS|^|54.0101|^|SC|^|197S AF. Haitian Revolution.
This course will examine the only successful slave revolution in world history, the Haitian Revolution. In 1789, Saint Domingue was the most prosperous Caribbean colony, and was the jewel of the French Empire. In 1804 former slaves and people of color declared Haiti an independent country, but they were masters of a devastated land. We will try to focus on a variety of themes throughout the course, including but not limited to slavery, race, colonialism, and the limits and legacy of revolution. Spring 2012 only. A. Silverman.

|#|HMSC121  SC|^|Cultr,Colonialsm+Postcolonialsm|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|121. Culture, Colonialism and Postcolonialism.
This course is about culture and the legacy of colonialism. With references to novels and other texts we will define culture and colonialism, and then explore the place of culture in the colonial enterprise. Postcolonialism follows colonialism, or does it? With reference to recent films we will consider how "post" Postcolonialism really is today. A. Long.
|#|HMSC123  SC|^|Philosophy/History of Culture|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|This course will focus on some of the major work in post-Enlightenment (19th and 20th centuries) thinking about culture: Kant's Third Critique, Schiller's Aesthetic Education, Arnold's Culture and Anarchy.

The course will problematize the relationship of postcolonial theory as a field to discourses in feminist theory, globalization and transnationalism and application of the theories to real-world situations. |#|HMSC135  SC|^|Language, Culture and Society|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|135.  Language, Culture and Society.
This course will consider the roles of language in culture and society by considering its functions in the construction of the self, mind, sexuality, gender, class, 'race,' colonialism and postcolonialism.  We will look at both literary and theoretical texts in order to explore the isssues.  A. Crowley.|#|HMSC136  SC|^|Critical Theory & Modern Culture|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|This course explores historical and contemporary efforts to analyze and understand the complex relationship between culture and political economy.

|#|HMSC138  SC|^|Genet|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Among an impressive group of post-World War II European writers, Jean Genet stands out as perhaps the most versatile.  He was, at once, novelist, playwright, philosopher, filmmaker, memoirist, and polemicist. Is this the reason why Genet's works, though lauded by both Sartre and Derrida, today occupy a "minor" position in both the academy and the literate world beyond? Through a close reading of some of his most important texts, this course will consider how Genet deployed and confronted sexuality, family, morality, and nation as interrelated aspects of the operations of inclusion/exclusion so central to modern Western societies. This course is designed for mature audiences. |#|HMSC138  SC|^|Genet|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Among an impressive group of post-World War II European writers, Jean Genet stands out as perhaps the most versatile.

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and oneâs place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the âessayisticâ and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the âessayâ does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, ChrisMarker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, AgnÃ¨s Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and JaâTovia Gary.|#|HMSC142  SC|^|British Domestic Interiors|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|This course explores cultural representations of the domestic interior and its relation to identity formation in literature, film, as well as historical and social documents.

The Scholar and the Athlete

The scholar and the athlete have long existed in a complex and contested relationship both in the history of higher education and in American culture at large. This interdisciplinary course aims to study that relationship from a variety of perspectives: historical, philosophical, sociological, and institutional. We will trace modern views of the scholar and the athlete back to classical and Enlightenment theories of education and the good life and then study how these roles have been represented and reconfigured both in the university setting and in contemporary public policy debates.  Cross-listed as LIT 099 JT.

|#|ITAL121  SC|^|Italian Fairy Tales|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|Even though Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Puss in Boots are among the most popular tales on a global scale, their Italian origins remain unknown or unclear to many. This course aims at unveiling the Italian fairy tale and folk tale traditions and depictions of the human condition through the works of authors such as Straparola (c.1480-1557) and Basile (1566-1632), the founders of this genre, who first blended realistic and fantastical elements in their collections. Students will read and analyze fairy tales written between the Renaissance and today in relation to the cultural milieu in which they originated and their adaptations in other genres and literary traditions. While it is true that numerous fairy tales were initially aimed at spreading civic and familial values among children and young adults, we will examine how many also contributed to the construction and perpetuation of stereotypes, gender roles, and discrimination. In this course, we will discuss questions concerning the narratological and literary aspects of fairy tales, the relationship between fairy tales and national identity, and the reworking of older fairy tales and the production of new ones, in regard to contemporary culture and its aspirations and anxieties. The course will end with readings of the latest âfairy talesâ inspired by recent events such as the Mediterranean refugee crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.|#|ITAL123  SC|^|Renaissance Italian Literature|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|The course, conducted in Italian, introduces students to the history of Italian Literature from the middle of the 14th century to the 16th century focusing on great masterpieces and less known works who have set a milestone in different literary genres and in the circulation of ideas. An interdisciplinary approach to the works of Castiglione, Della Casa, Machiavelli, Aretino, Straparola, Ariosto, and Gaspara Stampa (among the others) will provide further analysis and understanding of the cultural context of the Italian Renaissance, an era that witnessed the birth of the Italian fairy tale tradition, the unique contributions that women made to the early modern Italian society, and a mushrooming of pivotal political ideas and topics such as the relationship between ethics and politics, and the theoretic foundations of the buon governo. Particular emphasis will be given to the interrelationships between literature and other aspects of life in Renaissance Italy, such as politics, religion, social trends, and culture.

|#|ITAL141  SC|^|Italian History Through Film|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|This course will examine the important events that marked Italian history (1861-present) through the analysis of films produced during and/or about those times. We will not concentrate on film history, but rather on how cinema has portrayed history over the years. For this reason, the course will not explore well known materpieces of Italian cinema, but we will instead analyze the impact of less known productions, films made for television or films that were not destined to foreign distribution, in order to analyze how Italian history has been translated in to the popular imaginary. The course will be taught entirely in Italian.|#|ITAL142  SC|^|Italian Cinema & Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course offers an introduction to Boccaccio's Decameron, one of the masterpieces of Italian literature, through a close reading of Boccaccio's collection of hundred tales, an investigation of the literary traditions (tradizioni) that converge in the most important prose work of the Italian Middle Ages, and its cinematic "translations" (traduzioni/tradimenti). During the semester, we will read all the novellas that have been adapted for the screen by Pier Paolo Pasolini (Decameron, 1971), and the Taviani brothers (Magnifico Boccaccio, 2015) identifying the challenges that such a classical Italian work presents to Italian filmmakers in their attempts to transcribe it into an audiovisual spectacle. By reading and analyzing a large selection of Boccaccio's one hundred novelle, and watching and examining their corresponding filmic transpositions, we will address notions and problems of language, style, structure and content for each novella, together with the techniques of transposition of the written text to the movie screen. Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent.|#|ITAL143  SC|^|Contemporary Italian Music & Lit|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|143. Contemporary Italian Music and Literature.

|#|ITAL145  SC|^|Italian Literature of Gastronomy|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|The year 2020 marks the two hundredth anniversary of Pellegrino Artusi's birth, author of La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (1891), the most prominent and famous Italian cookbook in the history of gastronomy. However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen.  Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining "Italianess", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.	
Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent.|#|ITAL146  SC|^|Losers in Italian Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course scrutinizes and reconsiders the concept of losing and its implications by analyzing fictional characters from the Italian short story tradition (from its origins to the twentieth century) who have been addressed as "perdenti, reietti, inetti vinti, sconfitti, and falliti" but who, in the end, have made history in literature by showing how getting lost, losing, and being defeated should carry no shame because, as Umberto Eco claimed, "losers are much more interesting than winners, since they invite the readers to find the reasons for their failure." Course taught in Italian. |#|ITAL191  SC|^|Senior Thesis in Italian|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^||#|ITAL191  SC|^|Senior Thesis in Italian|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^||#|ITAL199  SC|^|Independent Study in Italian|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^||#|JAPN001A PO|^|Elementary Japanese|^|PALL|^||^|PO|^|A beginning Japanese language course stressing grammar, vocabulary building, oral and aural communication skills; introduction to the Japanese writing systems (katakana, hiragana and 86 kanji).

Prerequisite: 10.|#|LGCS110  PZ|^|Language & Gender|^|ZLIN|^||^|PZ|^|The relation between cultural attitudes and language.
The course will investigate how gender socialization is reflected in the structure of
language at all levels and the extent to which male/female patterns of language use
might contribute to the creation and/or maintenance of given structures of power,
solidarity, etc. Students will be expected to develop their own fieldwork-based
project.|#|LGCS112  PO|^|Language and Society|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|Language is an expression of our identity.

Students will do a fieldwork project. Prerequisite: LGCS 10 or permission of instructor.|#|LGCS114  PO|^|Linguistic Discrimination|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|This course is an introduction to the ways in which language can be used as a tool of empowerment or disempowerment for individuals and groups. In the modern public consciousness, racism, sexism, classism, etc. are generally considered to be taboo, however, prejudicial judgments about ways of speaking are seldom censured. In this class, students will learn about how prejudice manifests itself in language ideologies, social practices, and public policy. Students will produce their own research projects analyzing an aspect of linguistic discrimination and proposing strategies for addressing this type of inequality and educating the public about the role of language in discrimination. This class will be taught in the Inside-Out Prison Exchange format, alongside incarcerated students at the California Rehabilitation Center. Letter grade only.|#|LGCS118  PO|^|Morphosyntax|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|Human languages display an impressively diverse range of grammatical structures, from obvious differences in fundamental patterns of word order to very nuanced distinctions in a wide range of morphosyntactic constructions, such as: agreement patterns, case-marking patterns, morphological representation of the participants in an event, noun classification systems, voice (e.g. active, middle, passive, anti-passive), expression of tense, whether word order is rigid or flexible, and even the expression of sociolinguistic/discourse phenomena like politeness or reliability of evidence in grammaticalized forms. This course does not focus on syntactic theory, but instead introduces students to the wide range of grammatical structures that are possible in human language. The course includes overview readings and discussions of broadly attested morphosyntactic patterns. In addition, students will research an individual (unfamiliar) language over the course of a semester (based on existing research on the language) and will present the structures of their chosen language back to the class on a regular basis in both written and oral form. In this way the class serves to introduce students to the range of morphosyntactic constructions in a broad range of the world's languages. This course satisfies the 'Syntax' requirement of the Linguistics major, but it does not serve as a prerequisite for LGCS 183 Topics in Generative Syntax. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: LGCS 010  PO or equivalent.|#|LGCS119  PO|^|Language and Social Justice|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|This course gives an overview of ways that language interacts with social justice. We will discuss how criticism of minority languages and dialects is used as a proxy for the expression of racist views, how official language policies oppress immigrants and reflect xenophobia and racism, and how the field of linguistics uses a scientific approach to language that allows us to combat misconceptions about language that contribute to these and other social problems. Case studies to be covered include the George Zimmerman murder trial, the Oakland school board 'Ebonics' controversy, the 'English-only' movement in the US, examples of language endangerment and revitilization and language policies around the world.

The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasello's Construction Grammar (a theory of the child acquisition of syntax), and an introduction to Chomsky's Minimalist Program (a theory of adult language syntax). The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they don't have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora.

We will read seven works by Shakespeare and three by his contemporaries Marlowe, Tourneur, and Webster. Shakespeare's contribution to tragedy will be studied partly in the context of ancient and medieval as well as Renaissance conceptions of tragedy.|#|LIT 068  CM|^|Slow Shakespeare|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This course will be about the rewards, and pleasures, of reading Shakespeare's plays slowly--that is, of engaging in intensive study of a small number or plays rather than surveying the playwright's entire output in a single genre or period. We will read four plays, taking into account not only broader matters of plot, theme, character, identity, and ideology but also more minute matters of form and performance: diction, meter, syntax, pace, voice, gesture, action, and embodiment. Attention will also be given to recent theoretical treatments of close reading, performance practices, and Shakespeare's complex status in the contemporary world.
|#|LIT 069  CM|^|Shakespeare's Sonnets|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This course is focused on a single volume of poems which are among the most famous and canonical in English. We will read them closely, with particular sensitivity to their syntax and sonic structure. This will be a course not only in love poetry but in poetic style. We will consider diverse thematic readings and address arguments by Shakespeare's recent critics. We will often be studying the ways in which interpretability provides new life to old poems. And we will consider what other poets since Shakespeare have made of the sonnet form. We will be constantly studying very great verbal art.
|#|LIT 081  CM|^|Melville|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This seminar will examine the work and life of Herman Melville, one of the most complex and influential of American writers. After attention to several of the early novels, particularly Typee and Redburn, the focus will turn to the major novels, Moby Dick, Pierre, The Confidence Man, and Billy Budd, as well as the stories of The Piazza Tales. Melville's poetry, including the epic pilgrimage Clarel, will be considered in depth in the context of the Civil War and in relation to is ongoing spiritual occupations. Literary, religious, scientific, and political contexts will structure readings and discussions. Students are encouraged, though not required, to have taken a course in Shakespeare, the Bible, or Milton prior to enrollment. |#|LIT 091  CM|^|American Poetry|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|An introduction to major American poets including Emerson, Whitman, Melville, Dickinson, Frost, Stevens, Eliot, Lowell, and others.

We will follow Stevensâs career from his first collection, Harmonium (1923), to his last, Auroras of Autumn (1950). We will read Stevensâs letters, essays and lectures, though our focus will be on close reading and nuanced understanding of his poetry. To a get a sense of the poetic context in which Stevens is working we will look at the poetry of American contemporaries such as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams and H.D.

Politics and Literature: The Case of George Orwell

Course description: George Orwell was the most influential and controversial political novelist and essayist of the last hundred years. No one was better at telling people what they didn't want to hear and doing it in lucid, unforgettable prose. Orwell devoted his life to learning about and explaining important things-how to write, how to think, how to live, what to love, and what to fear. He wrote about colonialism, war, poverty, and oppression from a personal point of view. He was a convinced Socialist but a bitter critic of the Left, an internationalist but a patriot, a freedom fighter but a loner and lover of nature, an intellectual who spent his life exposing the foibles of intellectuals. We will follow the phases of Orwell's thought and experience though his own writings-from his school days to his time in Burma, his fight against fascism in Spain, his intellectual encounters with the different forms of totalitarianism, and his novelistic debate with Aldous Huxley over the future threat to freedom. 
|#|LIT 099  JT|^|Special Topics in Literature|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|Topic changes each semester. The topic for spring 2022 will be:

The Scholar and the Athlete

The scholar and the athlete have long existed in a complex and contested relationship both in the history of higher education and in American culture at large. This interdisciplinary course aims to study that relationship from a variety of perspectives: historical, philosophical, sociological, and institutional. We will trace modern views of the scholar and the athlete back to classical and Enlightenment theories of education and the good life and then study how these roles have been represented and reconfigured both in the university setting and in contemporary public policy debates. Cross-listed as ID  150  JT.
|#|LIT 100  CM|^|Literary Theory Since Plato|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|What is a good book? How do we decide whether a work of literature is worth reading? What is the basis of literary judgment? How do we bring history, religion, and myth to bear on our understanding of literary texts? How does imaginative literature differ from other forms of discourse? These are among the fundamental questions explored in this course through the eyes of major literary thinkers. The course examines literary criticism as a discipline with unique traditions of inquiry beginning with classical debates about form and reality and the tensions between the moral and aesthetic dimensions of literature as they have been engaged by such writers as Plato and Aristotle, Sidney, Johnson, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Arnold and Pater, Woolf, and Eliot. |#|LIT 107  CM|^|African American Poetry|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|Through reading, writing, and discussion, this course will introduce students to some of the most influential literary and vernacular poetry emerging from the African American cultural context. For the most part, these literary and vernacular works will be considered in relation to the historical moments in which they were produced. This historicized approach will enable class discussions to focus on the way in which black poetics has chronicled, reflected, and contributed to African Americans' varied, vexed relation to the American "democratic project." Attention to history will also lead students into considerations of the intimate connection between the aesthetic choices of African American poets and the evolving legal, economic, and social statuses of black people in America.
|#|LIT 107  HM|^|Fourteen Poems: Intro to Poetry|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|In this course, we study what poetry is and how it is used in the world. Neither strictly canonical nor historical in approach, this course introduces students to a wide range of English-language poems, most of them from the last two centuries. In most weeks throughout the semester, we focus on one or two primary poems (fourteen primary poems in all), with the support of companion poems that provide context. This course is writing intensive.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 108  CM|^|Poetry and Philosophy|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course will give an overview of the main conceptions of the relationship between poetry and philosophy in Western culture, from classical antiquity to the present. It will proceed through a series of questions. The first of these are: What is poetry? What is philosophy? How might they best relate to one another? Why does Plato refer to an "ancient enmity" between poetry and philosophy? Why might there be tension between the two activities? How might they be harmonized? What is the relation of reason to imagination?

Attention to history will also lead students into considerations of the intimate connection between the aesthetic choices of African American writers and the evolving legal and social statuses of black people in America.

Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks. Students will be asked to pay a $15 course fee to cover the cost of a required safety whistle and a class t-shirt, to be donned by all students for all class sessions.|#|LIT 130  CM|^|Introduction to Film|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|From its inception, cinema has often been conceptualized as having a "language" of its own. This course examines that metaphor from aesthetic, cultural, social, and historical perspectives. We will begin with a close analysis of a contemporary popular film, in an effort to "defamiliarize" typical conventions of cinematic expression, and then proceed through a study of multiple movements and genres in the history of film, from German Expressionism to the French New Wave, from Hollywood to documentary to avant-grade and independent filmmaking. Overall, the course is intended to provide students with a broad introduction to film analysis and to the field of Film Studies. |#|LIT 130  CM|^|Introduction to Film|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|From its inception, cinema has often been conceptualized as having a "language" of its own.

Topics such as cinematic response to World War II, the decline of the studio system, and "new waves" of European filmmaking are studied in social, cultural and aesthetic perspectives.|#|LIT 134  CM|^|Special Studies in Film|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|A seminar designed to explore the aesthetic achievement and social impact of film as an art form. Subjects for study include such topics as specific film genres, the work of individual film-makers, and recurring themes in film. Each year the seminar concentrates on a different area - for example, "Film and Politics," "The Director as Author," or "Violence and the Hero in American Films." Repeatable for differing topics.

The topic for spring 2021 is Spy Films.

This course focuses on spy-thrillers.  The films are entertainments, but they deal directly with political subjects; they imagine ways of being a patriot, an effective agent, a reliable civil servant, and of pursuing the interests of a state beyond lawful, acknowledged procedures.  We will emphasize interpretations that engage these concerns, and look to some essays by political philosophers to guide our analyses.   Students will write two papers of about 8 pages, and introduce one film to the class.  Their grades will be determined on the basis of (1) the quality of their writing, (2) the acuteness of their analyses, (3) and their class participation. Here are our films:
 
Notorious (1946) 
North by Northwest (1959)
Manchurian Candidate (1962)
Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965)
Three Days of the Condor (1975)
Tinker, Tailor (1979; 2011) 
Man on Fire (2004) 
Lives of Others (2006)
Traitor (2008) 
L'Affaire Farewell (2009)
Page Eight [Worricker] (2011)
Homeland (2011-19)
A Most Wanted Man (2014) 

THIS COURSE WILL BE ENTIRELY SYNCHRONOUS ON ZOOM.  ALL STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL MEETINGS OF THE COURSE.  NO EXCEPTIONS. 
|#|LIT 136  CM|^|American Film Genres|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|Mainstream genres can be seen as expressions of American culture's popular mythology.  This course will concentrate on selected genres to examine the social values, issues, and tensions that underlie these narratives and their characteristic ways of resolving fundamental societal conflicts.

The genre for spring 2022 will be, "The Hollywood Western."
This course focuses on that most distinctively American of all film genres, the Western. We will explore such themes as wilderness vs. civilization; race relations; gender roles; and notions of American national identity. Students will engage in close study of about 10-12 films, and will read background materials in film criticism, American history, and the culture of the American west. Our main goal will be to achieve a deeper understanding of the Hollywood Western in and of itself and as a significant historical and political phenomenon. In addition, the course seeks to enhance studentsâ writing skills and to give students more expertise in viewing, understanding, and writing about the great art form of cinema.  Written work consists of essays of varying length, a midterm, and take-home final project.|#|LIT 156  HM|^|Translation/Foreignness of Lang|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This seminar is designed to introduce students to the foreignness of language through literary translation theory and its praxis. Participants will develop individual projects that will be revised and workshopped over the course of the semester. Weekly readings, including essays by theoreticians, accomplished writer-translators, and selections of multiple translations of a single text, will be used to familiarize students with a range of perspectives on translation and its relationship to writing. Prerequisite: Students must have reading knowledge of at least one foreign language.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 160  CM|^|Science & Faith in Modern Lit|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|A study of the origins and impact of nihilism in modern literature. Beginning with Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, and James, the course will look at major 20th-century authors as a battleground between scientific realism and faith. T. S. Eliot, Frost, Hardy, Auden, Camus, Mann, Milosz, and Simone Weil will be among the major authors considered against the background of biology, psychology, and physical science.|#|LIT 162  AF|^|African Literature|^|MMOD|^||^|CM|^|Reading and analysis of novels, poetry, and essays representing the most important trends in modern African literature.

|#|LIT 179AEHM|^|We and You|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course explores the poetics, politics, and practice of we- and you-narratives. Through the reading and writing of we and you texts, we will examine how these stories exploit ambiguities in narrative identity. How do readers reconcile the paradox of a singular communal voice? In second-person stories, what do we make of you's ability to simultaneously refer to the reader, a disembodied narrator, and a fictional character? Mobs, high school cliques, refugees, undercover spies, and, of course, you will narrate our course readings. The syllabus will include work by the following writers: Junot Díaz, Jennifer Egan, Mariana Enríquez, Jeffrey Eugenides, William Faulkner, Steven Millhauser, Julie Otsuka, and Justin Torres. |#|LIT 179AFHM|^|Who's Afraid of Crit Race Theory|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Borrowing its title from Derrick Bell's foundational article, this course investigates our current cultural obsession with Critical Race Theory. In recent years, CRT has emerged in the American cultural consciousness as a bogeyman that will pervert the "truth" of American history. To grasp why CRT is being mobilized as anti-American or anti-western, we will first aim to understand what CRT is and then explore theories of race beyond legal theory to investigate how race structures our society, institutions, and our lives. Our course aim will be to understand how race, as both whiteness and non-whiteness is a constitutive feature of Anglo-American society and culture. Readings will include, Charles Mills, Stuart Hall, James Baldwin, WEB DuBois, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia Hill Collins, Cheryll Hines, among others. |#|LIT 179V HM|^|Forking Paths Fiction Workshop|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Forking Paths is an intermediate workshop focused on the art of fiction writing with a particular emphasis on the production of multimodal and multicursal narratives. In addition to working on the craft of their narrative prose, students will experiment with a variety of design and visual elements. 
Prerequisites: One previous workshop or two courses in English/Literature. Instructor permission required. Writing Intensive.  |#|LIT 183  CM|^|Advanced Fiction Writing|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This advanced fiction workshop is intended for people who have taken at least one semester of Fiction Writing (Lit. 38).  Each student will submit two stories or novel excerpts for workshop, where they will be carefully critiqued by the class.  We'll also read short fiction by well-known contemporary writers, with an eye toward what makes these stories original, entertaining, and complex.  In class, we'll look beyond basic elements of craft and address issues of concern for the experienced writer.  How do we avoid cliche?  Create narrative drive?  Take risks with form, language, and subject matter? Written exercises will focus on these issues while challenging students to push their writing in unexpected directions. May be repeated once for credit. May count toward the CMC literature major only once. Prerequisite: LIT 038 CM.  |#|MATH001  PO|^|Math, Phil & the Real World|^|PMAT|^||^|PO|^|Throughout history, mathematics has changed the way people look at the world. This course will include examples such as: Euclidean geometry (which suggested to philosophers that certainty was achievable by human thought), discussions of the infinite (which confounded the believer and the agnostic alike) and probability and statistics (which gave scientists a way of dealing with events that did not seem to follow any laws but those of chance). Readings and problems will be taken from several types of sources, including historical, mathematical and philosophical texts. Offered jointly by Pitzer and Pomona colleges.

Worldbuilding is the practice of creating a fully developed fictionalized environment in which the political, historical, cultural, environmental, philosophical (and more) are fully conceptualized and explored. Throughout the semester, students will engage with different forms of concepting and world-design such as creative writing, storyboarding, digital painting and photobashing in order to understand and visualize their respective worlds. This will ultimately culminate in the creation of a media artwork that portrays a narrative within this created universe. In addition to this, we will engage with a variety of films, artworks, games and more to learn about the process of world creation.  |#|MS  038  SC|^|Machine Learning for Artists|^|SMS|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|Machine learning (ML) is a new branch of computer science that provides services for automatic translation and speech recognition (Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant), product recommendations (Netflix, Amazon, etc.), transportation (Waymo, Tesla, the City of Copenhagen), and political campaigns (Facebook and Cambridge Analytica). ML is becoming a familiar presence in our lives; computer scientists and developers introduce new applications every day for chatting with humans, recommending the best course of action, and making predictions about the future. In spite of all the press, ML remains daunting to non-specialists. This class seeks to mend this divide. This class will introduce ML concepts to students without prior experience and provide templates to get students working in ML right away. We will study and remake artworks by Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler, Sougwen Chung, Memo Akten, Helena Sarin, Tom White, and others.

Prerequisite: MS 049 SC, MS 050 PZ, or MS 051 SC. |#|MS  121  PZ|^|Cultural Politics of Self Care|^|ZMDS|^||^|PZ|^|"Self care" has become a ubiquitous buzzword attached to an enormous variety of practices (including social media and celebrity, entrepreneurship, and the fitness, wellness, and food industries) and has reshaped notions of leisure, work, health, and travel. At the same time, scholars, journalists, and activists have criticized
this term as a rebranding of preexisting exclusionary practices around ability, shape and size, access to healthcare and food, and economic position. Positioning this term within a variety of theoretical modes-- including media studies, anthropology, global health, disability studies, fat studies, and critical theory,--this class will unpack the cultural politics of the term.|#|MS  122  PZ|^|Popular Feminism|^|ZMDS|^||^|PZ|^|This course will critically examine trends in feminist scholarship and popular culture in the last twenty years to examine what happens when feminism becomes âtrendy.â  Using case studies from media representation, blogs, advertising, and social mediaâsuch as #metoo, girlboss, girl power, and flawlessâthis course will interrogate how the positioning of feminism as a brand upholds the structural systems it seeks to undermine.  We will use these case studies to think about the ways popular feminist discourse positions intimate relationships, the domestic, the workplace, and social interactions in the contemporary moment and what they expose about the position of women worldwide.|#|MS  125  PO|^|Critical Game Studies|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course provides students with the intellectual framework and critical vocabulary to examine video games as media texts via aesthetics: the value of gameplay experiences and how we fit them into our lives. How do we play, and why? The course will also address questions of politics: how can games shape, and how are they shaped by, the current of public life? Who gets to play, particularly along lines of race, gender, sexuality, and class? Live and recorded gameplay demonstrations will provide students with the material for criticism and inquiry, alongside contemporary critical games writing that will serve as models for their own writing projects. Participants do not need previous experience with games or computers, but only a willingness to engage with games and gameplay within a critical context. Prerequisites: One of MS  049  PO, MS  050  PO, MS  051  PO or MS  092  PO.|#|MS  125  PO|^|Critical Game Studies|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course provides students with the intellectual framework and critical vocabulary to examine video games as media texts via aesthetics: the value of gameplay experiences and how we fit them into our lives.

|#|MS  131  PO|^|The "Two" and Media|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course focuses on theoretical questions regarding the "two": the social tie, friendship, confession, and the relationship between the individual subject and the group. This class will ground its inquiry in the fundamental question: what do we make of the encounter between the one and an(other)? To answer this, we will examine a challenging set of philosophical texts and a range of media that revolve around the intersubjective relation (or non-relation) of two central characters or figures. Objects of study will include Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy, Phoebe Waller-Bridge's television series Fleabag, Season 1 of Sarah Koenig's podcast Serial and Fumito Ueda's classic minimalist video game Ico.

Learn how traditional narrative principles such as character, setting, and plot function within indeterminate and variable experiences that range from mainstream video game to tabletop role-playing and experimental digital/theatre works. Embark on creative writing and design projects that integrate narrative and algorithmic/rule-based play in digital and non-digital form.

This semester, we will use the topic of games to unpack notions of interaction within a productive set of limits.  Games are interactive media.  And more and more, they are everywhere.  While Eric Zimmerman calls our present moment the "ludic century," Alex Galloway describes it as "an era of ludic capitalism."  In this moment, making and playing games ranges across the personal, political, professional, prescribed, and performative.  Students will explore central questions in media theory and game studies while developing projects about formal, material, technical, social, and theoretical understandings of interaction. Prerequisites: MS 049, 050, or MS 051.|#|MS  133  PO|^|Interactive Narrative Design|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course situates narrative writing as a key design practice for the creation of games and other interactive experiences.

Course is equivalent to MS  131  SC.|#|MS  138  SC|^|Media and the Environment|^|SMS|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|This course introduces students to the field of the environmental humanities through the tools of ecocriticism, media studies, and cultural studies. In particular, it is interested in exploring the many relationships between media and the environment, including not only the representations of the natural world in media such as film, photography, and digital media but also the material entanglements of media technologies with surrounding built and natural environments. |#|MS  140  PO|^|Screening Violence|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|The focus of this course is on representations of violence on screens and its widespread consumption. Through a range of theoretical texts and in conjunction with detailed analysis of select films and media, this course examines and debates the various, competing accounts of depicting, disseminating, and consuming images of violence. How did the omnipresence of scenes of violence on screens become a transnational phenomenon? Why does it have the power to move, excite or titillate us? What is our responsibility to images of violence, if any? These are some of the questions we will address as we chart the history of screening violence from early film and media to the present. Letter grade only. |#|MS  141  PO|^|Cinema, Sensation, and the Body|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|To what extent does watching a movie imitate the body's own sensorial encounters with the world? How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema's bodily representations and the relationship between the viewer's body and the events on the screen. Our approach is organized around a diverse cross-section of film screenings that include art cinema, experimental cinema, Hollywood melodrama, global cinema, and body horror. Turning attention to what is at stake when we consider what it means to feel cinema permits a wide range of critical approaches to screen media including continental philosophy, media theory, genre theory, experimental cinema, and feminist thought. Throughout the semester, we will become better acquainted with the sensuous facets of cinema along with the social, political, and aesthetic possibilities cinema affords when understood as both appealing to a sensuous body and being a sensuous body in its own right. Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, or MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO or equivalent. Letter grade only.|#|MS  144  PO|^|Masculinities|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course explores how in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, masculinity has served as a constant (and constantly shifting) object of cultural fantasy, inextricable from the changing ways we understand and imagine gender, sex, class, race, and nation. Precisely because, in the US and Europe, white masculinity has named a position (or fantasy) of cultural dominance; one often confused with the ostensibly "universal." We will focus especially on the minoritarian and situated perspectives on masculinity opened up by nonwhite, trans, queer, and/or feminist writers, theorists, and film-makers.|#|MS  146  PO|^|Temp. of the Moving Image|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course will concentrate on time as a category of analysis. Cinema possesses distinct affinities with the rationalization of labor and standardization of time that took place at the end of the nineteenth century, and yet it also provides a way of negotiating and resisting these processes, as it imagines alternative relations to standardized time. The course begins from the proposition that cinema provided a way for the twentieth century to re-think its changed relation to time after industrial modernity. Topics will include amnesia, boredom, duration, distraction, memory, the supposed death of cinema, real time, and simultaneity. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO.|#|MS  147H PO|^|Reality, Realism and the Real|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|In the humanities, Realism has been criticized for impressing upon audiences the illusion that they are watching real life events unfold spontaneously before their eyes - an illusion that takes on a politically conservative role as a vehicle for the circulation of dominant ideological meanings. In the sciences, by contrast, Realism has attracted far more favorable reviews: for example, Einstein writes that "If one renounces this assumption [of Realism]then I do not see what physics is supposed to describe." In this course we will examine the interplay between these two attitudes towards Realism. In particular we will suggest that it is possible to recuperate a politically progressive role for Realism as an aesthetic-representational form. Letter grade only.

It situates contemporary examples of the mediated forms of surveillance and monitoring in historical and theoretical perspective, drawing on critical theories of the relationship between surveillance, observation, power and control. The course will explore a range of ways of thinking about the roles of observer and observed as well as the relationship between media technologies and techniques of observation. Letter grade only.

It invokes the drone -- understood not just as a weaponized device but as forming part of a distributed, mobile, interactive, information network -- to explore emerging logics of interactivity, data processing and automation. The course will rely upon critical theory to examine the development of asymmetrical power and remote control associated with drones and will situate the drone within the cultural imaginary, drawing upon the historical relationship between military and media technology. The goal will be to use the figure of the drone to illuminate more general logics of cybernetic control -- their fantasies and actualities and the ways in which these relate to historical figures of automata, telepresence and action-at-a-distance. Additionally, the class will explore and critique theoretical developments that anticipate the forms of knowing, sensing and experiencing associated with the figure of the drone. Letter grade only.|#|MS  148D PO|^|Powers of Pleasure|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course interrogates John Fiske's contention that "pleasure may be the bait on the hook of hegemony, but it is always more than this; it always involves an element that escapes the system of power." With this claim in mind, we will: 1) evaluate key arguments in the field regarding pleasure's complicity with dominant ideological frameworks--particularly with regard to normative views of gender, race, class and sexuality; 2) consider ways in which the critique of pleasure itself may collude with patriarchal, racist, clasist and heteronormative systems of thought; and 3) explore the possibilities for pleasure to undermine established systems of power.

May be repeated once for credit. |#|MS  150  PO|^|Seriality|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|Serial media is ubiquitous. The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the 'binge model' of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory. Looking to psychoanalysis, existentialism, radical feminism, and Black Marxism, with supplemental examination of narrative, audience, and authorship studies, this course will aim to understand seriality as a textual, social, psychical, and political form.

The biggest drop off of girls in computer science is between the ages of 13 and 17 (Girls who Code). This course seeks to change this trend by setting up intergenerational mentorship teams made up of girls and other BIPOC pre-college youth, Scripps and other 5C students,and mentors in the fields of computational media and digital arts. Drawing upon the extensive resources of the Processing Foundation and the School of Poetic Computation and structured as a teaching practicum, students will explore digital pedagogy and curriculum development while gaining first hand experience in navigating and building digital communities. Students will work directly with Pacific Islander focused groups such as, but not limited to PIEAM, Purple Maia, and Kamehameha Schools, and will participatein a 4 hour/week for 10 week practicum placement with one or two pre-college youth.|#|MS  153  PO|^|The Original Television Series|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|The Original Television Series from "The Sopranos" to "Mad Men.". The course examines the original television series, a prominent development in U.S. television and, more broadly, in American culture during the last decade.  We discuss representative texts in this genre, among them The Sopranos, The Wire, and Mad Men, and examine the genre's distinctive features.  We also look at how television series engage with American culture.

Students will build photographic devices, reproduce chemistry, and make images following techniques ranging from archaeological optics, lensed cameras, all the way to the first digital sensor cameras.  Activities include building camera obscuras, pinhole cameras, lensed cameras, and electronic light sensors. Students will use these devices to create projections, photograms, cyanotypes, and electronic images. We will pay special attention to the work required to create durable images and consider a range of ideas about the legibility and meaning of photography.|#|MS  160  SC|^|Computational Photography II|^|SART|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|Computers can correct flaws in traditional photography, and photographers are happy to use some or all of these tools to improve their images. Focus, aperture, and shutter may be automated alone or in concert. These fixes are just the beginning of the ways that computation will change photography. Soon cameras will make images without optics, manipulate time to sharpen the image, even see around corners to recover faces. We will study the impacts that computational photography will make on the arts, consider the consequences of new propaganda, and propose tactics to deal with these disruptions.  Part 2 builds on our study of cameras and representation and moves into computer vision, image processing, digital cameras, image segmentation, high-dynamic-range imaging, texture analysis and synthesis, object detection, and projector-camera systems. Course work includes implementing relevant algorithms and completing a final project.  Prerequisite: MS159SC (CP1) or introductory programming class. |#|MS  165  PO|^|Black Popular Culture|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course will critically examine the role of media (including, but not limited to: cinema, television, music, journalism, and video games) in facilitating, disseminating, and challenging social, political, and cultural constructions of 'blackness.' We will analyze the production and consumption of black representations in mainstream American media and explore the ways these processes influence basic assumptions about social roles, expectations, and norms that tend to inhere to concepts of 'blackness' and black popular culture. Students will be encouraged to develop a critical and political consciousness around historical formations of black identity, their own participation in embracing and/or resisting black representations, and the impact of black popular culture on their lived experiences. The course will be structured as a seminar and will emphasize collaborative thinking and discussion. Each class will feature a media component, a brief lecture putting the assigned media and readings into context, followed by collective discussion and contribution.

This course examines some of the key factors that have contributed to the horror genres capacity to maintain its continued viability in popular culture across a wide range of media including graphic novels, video art, and interactive gaming. Beginning with the modern period of the American horror film and then expanding beyond its physical and ideological borders, this course is designed to encourage students to challenge the ideas that have become associated with the term "horror," and to consider whether some other term or terms may be better suited to describe the types of feelings horror films and its related forms of media actually inspire. We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response? Is it possible to locate cinematic representations of horror and its experience outside of the horror genre? Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, or MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO or equivalent. Letter grade only.|#|MS  180  PO|^|The War Film|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course surveys the history of the war film. Our focus will center mainly upon Hollywood cinema's depiction of warfare, but the course also expands beyond American borders to explore the genre in a global context. While the Hollywood war film can often serve as a platform for glorifying armed conflict and celebrating the heroism of the combatant, it has also historically been a site of political and ideological critique, and has served as a barometer of the social mood and public perception of warfare. Throughout the semester we will examine representations of war in cinema across the 20th century and into the 21st century, tracking its impact and its aftermath at the level of the political and social, but also at the level of the subjective and the psychological. We will develop the critical and theoretical frameworks necessary to grapple with aesthetics of violence, reading work from Prince, Massumi, Baurillard, Virilio, Foucault, and Scarry, among others. Topics will include, torture, preemption, genocide, trauma, deterrence, revenge, reintegration and forgiveness. Letter grade only.

More than presenting a series of individual case studies, we seek and forge pathways of understanding across time period and national divide, to articulate ways in which queerness?here broadly defined as the experience of 'otherness' in gender or sexual identity relative to societal expectations?inevitably enlivens and drives forward the very cultures and characters that ostensibly serve to suppress it. In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more.

Yet political divisions of race, class and gender are manifest in disagreements as to whom the music belongs. This course focuses on how the concept of race has "colored" American popular music, and addresses the issue of expressive authenticity: are the kinds of understanding critical to authentic performance in a musical style accessible only to members of the community from which it originates? Relationships between race and gender in blues and jazz historical discourse will also be explored. Previous musical training is desirable but not required. This course satisfies the fine arts requirement.|#|MUS 123  SC|^|Music & Performance of Identity|^|SMUS|^||^|SC|^|This course explores the ways in which individuals and groups represent, transform, and create their identities through musical performance and other performative acts. Several issues of "musical identity" are discussed: creation and expression of gender through music, musical expressions of ethnic and/or racial identity, musical creation of "official" identities (including U.S. nationalism), and the representation of the self through music.

|#|ORST114  PZ|^|Social Change and Organizations|^|ZORG|^||^|PZ|^|This course explores the role of organizations in transformational social change, broadly speaking. It provides students 
with a comprehensive understanding of how organizations within various sectors in society such as media, tech, education, 
politics, and non-profit, become essential elements of modern society and how these organizations influence social 
institutions. In this context, we will learn about social order, social stratification, inequality, power, and the social 
movements that create their own organizational structures in their quest for social change. We take a critical and structural 
perspective to social change and understand it as both actions that propel society in new directions as well as actions that 
maintain the fundamental structures of society and the social order even in the midst of active resistance to those structures. 
We will use case studies of organizations to illuminate these issues.|#|ORST135  PZ|^|Organizational Behavior|^|ZORG|^||^|PZ|^|We will investigate individual, group and structural

College also represents some of our greatest challenges. As individuals, we may face anxiety, self-doubt, and isolation. As a community, diverse life experiences, socioeconomic backgrounds, and beliefs may clash, with no easy solutions. We are challenged when our aspirations are unmet and our imaginations unrealized. How can colleges craft responses to foster the promise of higher education--from opportunity and social mobility to inclusion and pluralism? What more can and should be done? Through course materials, in conjunction with our own experiences and analysis, we will situate the institution of higher education within the broader context of American society, politics, and the economy. As part of our collective journey this semester, we will practice a variety of learning modalities, including student-driven discussion, informal in-class writing, formal (out-of-class) writing, and group projects. Throughout, we will practice knowledge construction as a communal process rooted in open dialog, thoughtful analysis, intellectual curiosity, and self-reflection. NOTE: This course is held at a level Il men's prison in Norco, CA. A required $15 course fee covers the cost of a whistle and t-shirt, to be worn during all class sessions.|#|ORST165  PZ|^|US Democracy in Comp.Perspective|^|ZORG|^||^|PZ|^|This course explores contemporary themes in American democracy through a comparative lens.  What are the key elements of a healthy democracy? What are the key threats? Topics include democratic institutions, race, gender, class, media, parties, economics, voting behavior, voting rights, public opinion, political culture, and expertise in governing. Throughout we will draw parallels between American politics and social, political, and economic trends in other parts of the world--from advanced industrial democracies in Western Europe to uncertain democracies in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. While we pay particular attention to the elections of 2016 and 2020, we situate those events in a broader historical and global context. |#|ORST170  PZ|^|Science & Tech in Organizations|^|ZORG|^||^|PZ|^|Science and Technology in Organizations:
With this course, students will examine scientific and technological changes in organizations in light of the economic, cultural, and political systems within which they have developed, asking: How do innovations take place? Why does one advancement earn prominence over others? What have been the repercussions of transformative breakthroughs? We will discuss scientific, systematic, and product design in particular.|#|ORST175  PZ|^|Ethical Constructs for Orgs|^|ZORG|^||^|PZ|^|"Ethical Contructs for Organizations"

With this course we will explore the way in which ethics are debated and enacted in various organizational settings.The aim is to set up groundwork and establish a vocabulary for talking about ethics in the first place. Investigations
will follow a case study approach, centering on how ethics are applied within broad categories: science and technology; finance, business, and society; and the global world with its divisions and distinctions. People in all sorts of organizations
need to articulate what ethics are and to set up guidelines, since these do not just fall into place naturally. They must be intellectually constructed, hence the title, âethical constructs.â|#|ORST180  PZ|^|Black People in the Inlnd Empire|^|ZORG|^||^|PZ|^|Black People in the Inland Empire

gentrification, further economic marginalization and environmental racism.|#|ORST191  SC|^|Sr Thes: Organizational Studies|^|SOC|^|52.1003|^|SC|^|191.  Senior Thesis in Organizational Studies.

In this course we examine how people collectively organize in the 21st Century, the types of creative
social movement organizational structures that emerged from the first World Social Forum, and how
they influenced local movements like #BlackLivesMatter. Some movements captivate local imaginations
and others go global. What creative ways have movement organizers re-configured old ideas for the new
age and what new ones have emerged? The course is designed around three themes: What is to be done; How is it to be done; and The possibilities of what can be done.|#|PE  001  PO|^|Aerobics|^|PPED|^||^|PO|^|A challenging, fun aerobic exercise class using bench/step aerobics set to music and including athletic and dance movements.

the criminal justice system and that face them in prison and on release, the impact of the system on mothers and
families, and the gendered structure of prisons, among others. In addressing these themes, we will also consider
the nature and purpose of punishment, the current state of the criminal justice system, including the war on drugs,
mass incarceration and the growth of the prison-industrial complex, how we define or conceive of crime, the
relationships between the criminal justice system and other social and political institutions, whether prisons
should be reformed or abolished, changes being made, and how we can make change. Readings are from a variety
of sources and disciplines, including scholarly work, pieces from the media, work by advocacy organizations, and
firsthand accounts. The course is primarily discussion-based.

The topic for fall 2020 is: 

Intro: "Science, Technology, and Human values"

This introductory course presents a philosophical overview of the relationship between the pursuit of scientific knowledge, the development of technologies, and the expression of human values. In this class, students explore whether seemingly objective scientific inquiry can be affected by the social and cultural values of the scientific community. Broadly, we will focus on three inter-related topics: (i) evidence gathering and inductive reasoning, (ii) science as a value-free enterprise, and (iii) the nature of technological change through the explosion of big data and machine learning. Through these topics, we examine the values implicit in scientific culture and the extent to which these values do, can, and should guide the development of burgeoning technology.|#|PHIL039  PO|^|Gender, Crime and Punishment(CP)|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|Addresses issues of crime and punishment focusing on gender, race, and class.

Topics considered include: the relation of sex to gender; the nature of gendered oppression and its intersections with other forms of oppression; feminist and queer approaches to values and knowledge; and whether gender is a necessary or contingent feature of social relations.|#|PHIL046  PO|^|Feminism and Science (CP)|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|This course examines feminist perspectives on and critiques of science and technology, traditional scientific world views, and how gendered and other values inform scientific theory and practice.  Topics include the current and historical participation of women in science, with attention to race, class, and nationality; scientific theories of sex differences; the scientific construction of sex; issues in women's health; and environmental issues.  This is a Napier course and will include participation of about 6 elders from the Pilgrim Place retirement community, offering an opportunity for intergenerational discussion and mentoring.  |#|PHIL047  PO|^|Socrates|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|Socrates wrote nothing but is one of the most famous philosophers of all time. We will explore this and other Socratic paradoxes - for example his claims that he did not know anything but was wiser than anyone he had ever met; that knowledge and virtue are the same thing; that no one knowingly or willingly does wrong; that it is better to be the victim of injustice than to be unjust; that a worse person cannot harm a better one. We will also investigate his claim to be the first genuine philosopher, his importance in the subsequent history of philosophy and his iconic place in human culture.|#|PHIL052  PZ|^|Philosophy of Religion|^|ZPHI|^||^|PZ|^|The philosophy of religion is concerned with
philosophical reflection on a broad range of questions concerning religious belief.
The nature of religious belief is quite varied across cultures. In Western theism
belief in God and a belief in personal immortality are two central religious beliefs. So
philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine
similar philosophical questions from Western and Eastern religious traditions as well
as African, Native American and a variety of other world religions.|#|PHIL054  PO|^|Existentialism|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|How does one find meaning in a seemingly meaningless world?

This survey course covers a variety of philosophies of film, with special emphasis on continental European traditions including phenomenology, critical theory, Marxism, feminist and queer theory, and poststructuralism. The course also puts the philosophy of film in dialogue with the history of aesthetics, questioning whether film fits into traditional theories of art and whether film has the power to improve and/or corrupt societies. Periodic film viewings will also be required.|#|PHIL074  PZ|^|Power and Politics in Art|^|ZPHI|^||^|PZ|^|In our contemporary world saturated with images, how are relationships of power instantiated or challenged? If the artist is no longer considered a sovereign individual but a product of social forces, how should we conceive of the artwork? If the artist no longer has the authority to dictate the meaning of their work, what does that mean for aesthetic interpretation? How is it possible to analyze racialized and gendered power dynamics aesthetically? This course considers these questions through the lens of twentieth-century philosophy and Octavia Butler's Lilith's Brood. Movements covered include post-structuralism, French feminism, the Frankfurt School, and Black aesthetics.|#|PHIL080  PO|^|Philosophy of Mind|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|Philosophy of Mind.

Buddhist metaphysics aims at relieving suffering. For example, it might help to alleviate suffering to give metaphysical arguments against the existence of the self, and for the impermanence and emptiness of all things, or the interpenetration and interdependence of all things. We will look through this lens at selected theories and arguments from the history of both Buddhist and Western metaphysics. What can be learned when a class of students and a specialist in the history of Western metaphysics work together using Buddhist ideas as our main lens, and put the two traditions into dialogue?

The topic for Spring 2022 is "Democratizing Science" 
There are many decisions scientists must make that can't be assessed empirically. Consider, for example, defining concepts (like persistent headache or sexual harassment) or setting standards of proof (how much evidence must scientists collect that vaccine efficacy is waning, before publicizing their results?). Decisions like these involve moral, political, and personal values. This course will explore those value-laden aspects of science, focusing specifically on arguments for "democratizing" them - allowing members of the public, rather than professional scientists, to make them. |#|PHIL198  CM|^|Advanced Seminar in Philosophy|^|MPHI|^|38.0101|^|CM|^|Advanced study of selected topics in philosophy.

The language of political liberalism is so ubiquitous that many students will be unaware of how their own moral sensibilities and political intuitions are products of liberal thought.  In contrast, this course investigates Marxist and Post-Marxist political theory to explore radical perspectives on politics, economics, culture, and power. A basic familiarity with liberal political philosophy, while helpful, is not required.

This seminar will introduce students to the field of political science by placing American and international films in conversation with scholarship on power, politics, and storytelling. Each week we will study a film, read related research, and analyze how one informs our understanding of the other. The course will cover ethnic politics, broadly conceived with a particular focus on civil disobedience, protests and political violence. Related topics may include immigration, crime and the state, and urban politics. We will consider a range of questions including, how do stories influence our sense of self, community and nation? How do filmmaking techniques (e.g. cinematography, casting, sound design) influence which people and issues become salient? How do aesthetic and narrative choices affect attitudes about the social order and who is deserving of power? Through close readings of films, social science, and media studies scholarship, this course will enable students to study key political science concepts, the institution of cinema, and how stories make meaning.

Through close readings of both literary and legal texts, the course adopts a humanistic approach to legal scholarship, locating the force of law within its discursive and rhetorical dimensions.  Topics to be discussed include: rights to privacy, sexuality and reproductive freedom; sexual harassment and racist speech; anti-discrimination, integration, and affirmative action.  
|#|POLI145  SC|^|Race, Violence, and the Law|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context. Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration. |#|POLI145  SC|^|Race, Violence, and the Law|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context.

Taking the time to slow down, students are encouraged to linger in the richness and complexity of the text, to find pleasure in thinking more deeply and with care, and to resist feeling pressured always to read instrumentally. Reading slowly reminds us that reading well involves more than efficient processing of information and extraction of key points.

By drawing from readings in cultural studies, Black feminist theory, sociology, philosophy, and decolonial thought, the class explores questions surrounding the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlives. A crucial goal of the course is to engage critically the meaning of sexuality, intimacy, reproduction, labor, and domination in slaveholding societies. Throughout the course, students will discuss how the afterlives of slavery inform current ethical debates on issues like: sexual violence, reparations, surveillance, criminalization, incarceration, housing, militarism, imperialism, distribution of wealth, environmental racism, education, mental illness, political participation, and anti-colonial activism. The course is therefore structured less as a historical survey of slavery and more as an investigation as to how slavery is remembered and its rhetorical function when reasoning about today?s moral and political controversies. Special attention is paid to how a study of slavery?s afterlives challenges narratives of U.S. exceptionalism and innocence, as well as stories commonly told about freedom, emancipations, and racial progress. |#|POLI150  SC|^|Intro to Public Policy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course addresses the public policy process through policy formulation, implementation, and oversight in the United States. We will cover various dynamics of both formalized political institutions, particularly evinced through federalism and the separation of powers, as well as special interests and the prominence of "The Third House."

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility.  While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including "traditional" political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions.  Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as "hybrid effective governance," "heterarchy," "areas of limited statehood," "oligopolies of violence," and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.  Relying on international-relations and comparative-politics literature, this class surveys the rapidly expanding scholarship on the topic, questions the future of the nation-state, and discusses policy implications for the international community.

How does the process of political engagement affect outcomes?  How is the decision to talk or to fight, and the manner in which one talks or fights - mediated by identity, networks, and culture? And in what ways does past participation in contentious politics affect future political engagement?  This class explores these questions through theoretical readings, case studies from around the world, documentaries, negotiation simulations, and conversations with practitioners. Letter grade only.|#|POLI153  SC|^|Environmental Policy in the US|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course focuses on federal policy regarding the environment in the United States.

In this course, we will consider the factors that have how this historical background has shaped the contemporary politics and international relations of this fascinating region. We will cover topics such as communist legacies, post-communist democratization, nationalism and ethnic conflict, European Union enlargement, and current challenges such as populism and demoncratic regression. In addition to scholarly articles and books, we will engage with films from the region. Letter grade only.

Black feminism argues that the race/racism, gender identity, and class oppression are inextricably tied together. Womanist theology is a contemporary theological discipline that aims to place African American women at the center of God, The Bible, and life experience. This seminar seeks to place Black feminist thinkers in conversation with womanist theologians. The course aims to interrogate the rise of the first generation of womanist theologians and Black feminist thinkers; examine the coherence of key intellectual ideas; and analyze outstanding social, political, theological issues, and methodological approaches. Readings are exclusively and intentionally from the voices of African American/Black women. |#|POLI158  PO|^|Democratic Decay|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|In 1989, Francis Fukuyama famously declared liberal democracy the 'final form of human government.'

It is deeply concerned with the rise of China, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity and the resurgence of global terrorism given the recent U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the same time, however, the real costs to America's blood and treasure are driven by a global pandemic and climate change. What's the meaning of "national security", then? What are the U.S. intelligence and national security communities, the "military industrial complex" and how do they relate to civilian policymakers and influence actual policy decisions? Should traditional ways of understanding "national security" and "intelligence" be redefined? If so, how? After successful completion of this course you would not only have addressed these and other related questions in depth but also have a strong sense about how to approach any national security issue from more than one empirically-based angle, as well as a good notion of how to develop your own carefully crafted arguments--i.e. how to think critically--about any national security concern, and beyond.|#|POLI189Y PO|^|Libidinal Economy & Race|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|This seminar engages political theorists whose work on psychoanalysis and anti-Blackness are making important interventions in the field of critical race theory.

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion.

The course is divided into three roughly equal-sized sections. The first section offers an introduction to the two philosophical/theoretical traditions in international relations thought: rationalism (and its realist and liberal variants) and social constructivism (and its statist and global variants). The second section covers a series of significant periods in international political history from the emergence of the modern system of states in Europe in the sixteenth century to the end of the Cold War. The third section investigates various issues in contemporary international politics.|#|POST050  PZ|^|Politicl Thought East&West Intro|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Political Thought East and West: Intro to Political Philosophy

The study of political philosophy focuses on broad assumptions concerning human nature and the character of community organizations that regular activities and seek to promote happiness. These assumptions, structures and goals vary through time and across cultures. This class examines the texts of major theorists representing European, Chinese, Islamic, and Indian political thought and compare their arguments concerning the nature of freedom, justice, equality, authority and responsibility among other fundamental concepts. |#|POST060  PZ|^|Introduction to Public Policy|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course provides an overview of the processes
and politics of policy-making in the United States. We will explore normative issues
of equity and efficiency, consider advantages and disadvantages of policy-making in
different venues (courts, legislatures, bureaucracies) and explore the different
perspectives on the policy-making held by various actors.|#|POST070  PZ|^|Research Methods in Polit Stdies|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course explores the methods
employed in political studies research. The to primary goals of the course are: 1) to
provide new analytic tools that will help in the critical evaluation of social science
material; and 2) to improve students ability to pose and answer research questions
on their own.|#|POST091  PZ|^|Stats & Data Analysis|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Statistics and Data Analysis for Politics

This course introduces students to the basic methods of statistics and data analysis in political science research,
with a focus on making causal inferences about how politics works. The same methods also apply to social
science questions of cause-and-effect relationships more generally. This course provides students with extensive
experience in handling data to answer real-world problems. While it has a heavy component of using the
analytical software R, students are not expected to have any prior programming knowledge.|#|POST091P PZ|^|Stats & Data Analysis Practicum|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Statistics and Data Analysis for Politics Practicum

This practicum is the laboratory companion to POST091, "Statistics and Data Analysis for Politics.â Both must be taken
together to complete the course. In this practicum, students get a chance to practice data analysis hands-on with the
instructor. It focuses on developing coding skills in the software R and implementing specific tasks such as data description
and visualization that enable robust analysis and inference. |#|POST123  PZ|^|Building Political Parties|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course carefully explores the theory and practice of building political parties. Questions include: What future exists for political parties? How are they created? What are the possibilities and limitations of party-building as a political strategy? How has party-building changed over time  and how does it differ from place to place? What opportunities exist today for party building today? As a culminating project for the course, students will develop their own plans to build, reform, or recreate a party organization in a particular locality.|#|POST139  PZ|^|Politics of the Middle East|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|As the holder of one of the world's largest reserves of petroleum and natural gas, the Middle East has been the focus of regional and international competition for several decades. In this course we will analyze ideologies, actors, and events that have shaped the domestic, regional, and international policies of states of this region up until the present. Who are the major players in the political arena of the Middle East and what are the key issues of conflict and cooperation among states in the region and the world outside the Middle East? What are the domestic and international obstacles to democratization in the region? And finally, what factors triggered the rapid rise of diverse Islamist currents across the region and how can we explain the causes of violent sectarian conflicts in countries like Iraq and Syria?
|#|POST141  PZ|^|International Political Economy|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Examines the relationship between the
contemporary global economy and the nation-state through Liberal, Marxist and
Realist paradigms. Treats the evolution of the international trading and monetary
systems over the past two centuries, the relations between rich and poor countries,
the roles of global banks and corporations and the transitions to market economies
in Eastern Europe, Russia and China. Background in international politics and/or
international economics is desirable.
|#|POST144  PZ|^|Global Security|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the debate over security in a
global era. Is traditional national security obsolete, and should human security
replace it? A partial list of topics covered includes: great power competition,
terrorism, crime, cyber-warfare, economic instability, failed-states, and security of/
for societys vulnerable. Fall, G. Herrera.*|#|POST154  PZ|^|Street Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Since their emergence in 18th century England and France, social movements and street protests have been playing increasingly crucial roles in the political and social developments of almost every country. Examining the collective actions of students, women, youth, ethnic minorities, and poor people as vital forces towards change and democratization, this course investigates how various kinds of civil disobedience and everyday forms of resistance movements in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa utilized different tactics and strategies in their negotiations for their rights with authorities. 

Along the way, we will ask questions such as these: what are the differences between traditional collective movements and everyday forms of resistance?  What are the demographic and historical roots of these movements and how did they rise and fall? Why do the tactics of movements and actors differ across locations and times and why do some movements turn militant? And finally, how do the poor, as the most underprivileged crowd, mobilize in countries like Brazil, Egypt, Burma, and Iran against powerful states in their respective countries? |#|POST160  PZ|^|Racl Justice Initiative Polc Lab|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Racial Justice Initiative Policy Lab: Environmental Justice

The course is an intersection of public policy analysis and applied research. The diffused nature 
of the U.S. political system provides policy entrepreneurs with an opportunity to develop policy 
ideas and shape policy outcomes. Students will understand the roles research, expertise, and 
strategic communications play in shaping public policy. In this class, students will research a 
contemporary policy issue and develop a policy research brief drawing on existing data sets and 
original analysis. The RJI Policy and Issues Briefs will be published quarterly, widely 
disseminated and posted on the RJI Policy Lab webpage.  
In the fall of 2021, the course and lab will focus on environmental justice and environmental 
policy issues. While the readings cover environmental justice issues widely, we will center our 
analysis and work around local environmental justice work in the Inland Empire. We will work 
with the Robert Redford Conservancy to identify relevant partners to provide objective analysis and research in an effort to strengthen the work of advocates seeking to improve the health 
and wellbeing of local residents.  |#|POST162  PZ|^|Comparative Revolutions|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|In this course we will study comparative conceptual approaches to the causes, trajectories, and outcomes of the great revolutions of the modern world. Although infrequent, revolutions have profoundly transformed the political, cultural, and social structures of countries like France, Russia, China, Cuba, and Iran. Utilizing  theoretical models, we will discuss questions like these: is there a universal definition of revolution? Are there common causes for revolutions across time and space? What are the ideological, cultural, and economic origins of revolutions? And finally, why do some revolutions succeed and some fail?|#|POST165  PZ|^|US Democracy in Comp.Perspective|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course explores contemporary themes in American democracy through a comparative lens.  What are the key elements of a healthy democracy? What are the key threats? Topics include democratic institutions, race, gender, class, media, parties, economics, voting behavior, voting rights, public opinion, political culture, and expertise in governing. Throughout we will draw parallels between American politics and social, political, and economic trends in other parts of the world--from advanced industrial democracies in Western Europe to uncertain democracies in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. While we pay particular attention to the elections of 2016 and 2020, we situate those events in a broader historical and global context. |#|POST166  PZ|^|Politics & Arts of Resistance|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This seminar examines practices of resistance by people that the state has deemed backward. More specifically, the course compares resistance from below by supposedly backward peoples with forms of resistance by those who are more fully incorporated into state systems. The seminar relies heavily on the work of James Scott to bring this comparison into focus, pairing Scotts work with that of such other thinkers as W.E.B. Dubois, Pierre Castres, and Anna Tsing. By bringing together a wide range of lived experiences of domination and resistance to it, the course seeks to deepen our understandings of what political resistance is  and of how it has unfolded over time.|#|POST168  HM|^|Bicycle Revolution|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course explores the challenge of creating bike-friendly cities, using bicycle transportation as a window into broader themes surrounding the politics of social change in urban/ suburban settings. The course combines community engagement with an introduction to relevant research literatures. Each week we will ride along bike routes in the surrounding cities of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, meeting with community leaders.

but also the life chances of ordinary citizens. In this course, we explore the relationship between political selection and social 
mobility in comparative perspectives. By examining several cases around the world in great depth, we seek to understand why 
countries adopt different modes of selection (such as election, open examination, and patronage-based selection) and what 
impact each has on ordinary citizens in terms of their opportunity to ascend into the political class.|#|POST185B PZ|^|Empire and Its Critics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|How do people cope with empire? Drawing on contemporary and historical cases, this course asks and debates the following questions: How do empires form -- and when and why do they fall apart? What is it like under empires? What are the most effective means of challenging empires? What do people mean when they (sometimes) claim that the United States is (or has become) an imperial project? In asking these questions, this course considers the challenges posed to empires by territorial states, corporations, tribal and other non-territorial forms of political organization, and tribute systems.|#|POST190  PZ|^|Science, Politics & Alt Medicine|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|(Formally IIS 113) This

The topic for spring 2022 is: "Psychedelics, Mental Health, and Well-Being"

The U.S. is experiencing a mental health epidemic. One out of two Americans suffer from a mental illness during their lifetime, and there continues to be a shortage of therapists who can help address this problem. Moreover, psychiatric medications only work for about half of those who use them, but often come with significant side effects, problems with adherence, and problems with sustainability unless people continue on medications. Despite being made illegal in the 60âs, there has been a renewed interest in psychedelics and entheogens (plant medicine), with recent studies showing strong treatment effects even after only one dose/experience. These effects are both global to distress and specific to diagnoses such as major depression, generalized anxiety, eating disorders, panic disorder, chronic pain, PTSD, and substance addiction. In addition, many startups across the country are conducting clinical trials on many different types of psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD, mescaline, MDMA, DMT, and 5-MEO-DMT.|#|PSYC131L SC|^|Clinical Neuropsychology Lab|^|SPSY|^|42.0101|^|SC|^|This lab complements the content of Psychology 131.

You are to shock the "student" at increasing rates for every answer they get wrong. Eventually, you are required to shock them at a level capable of killing them. How far would you go? What factors are important in understanding how far you would go? Can evidence from such an experiment provide enough insight into why you may, or may not, be capable of committing acts of genocide? The course goal is to critically analyze experimental social psychology by applying it to the study of human nature and genocide. We will do this by studying classical social psychology paradigms and experiments. We will also engage with theories such as evolutionary psychology, cultural anthropology, Marxist psychology, and critical theoryallowing us to compare and contrast various ways of studying human behavior. In order to aid us in this journey, we will ask questions such as: What role does human nature play in genocide? Can human nature be discovered by the scientific method? Is human nature today the same as it was 15,000 years ago? Or, could genocide have happened 15,000 years ago?|#|PSYC180  CM|^|Forensic Psychology|^|MPSY|^|42.0101|^|CM|^|Examines the interaction of clinical psychology and law.

Autonomy, Self-Determination, and Conscience are central concepts in the Cognitive Science of the self and decision-making. Deciding who is autonomous, self-determined, and who does and does not possess a conscience has practical implications for whom clinicians, lawyers, and judges consider mentally competent and responsible for their own actions. The course will address major themes illustrating how interdisciplinary psychological science looks at and specifies what makes agents (human persons and putative AI agents) autonomous, whether this requires people to be fully free of any physical causes of their own brains, how drug use affects conceptions of autonomy in Cognitive Science, how clinical psychiatric and psychological conditions affect conceptions of autonomy in Cognitive Science, and how these conceptions make their way into policy and law. We will also examine what it means to be a self that is self-determining regarding one?s choices, identities, and affiliations, and how conscience emerges from heteronomy to autonomy, and whether there are scientifically defensible constructions of ?trusted autonomy? and moral responsibility in artificial intelligence.|#|PSYC188  CM|^|Psychology and Law|^|MPSY|^|42.0101|^|CM|^|Examines psychological assumptions and interpersonal processes in the American legal system.

The events of the apocalypse have also provided material for some of the most creative expressions of artistic, literary, and cultural phenomena throughout human history. This course explores some of the ways in which the apocalyptic is expressed across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and beyond while also addressing key theoretical concerns in apocalyptic studies.

Accordingly, the study of dietary practices can tell us a lot about a people. In this class we will study Jewish food customs from antiquity to the present and the ways in which food has played an integral role in shaping Jewish society and expressing Jewish identity. We will engage with a variety of topics, including the laws of kashrut (kosher law), ritual meals such as the Passover Seder, Jews as producers and purveyors of food commodities such as liquor and coffee, links between Jewish food practices and local cultures, the relation between food and gender, the role of agriculture in Zionism, what makes for Israeli cuisine, and ethical issues involved with food production and consumption.
|#|RLST064  CM|^|Islam in Motion|^|MRLS|^||^|CM|^|How does religion change across time and space? This course examines the ways in which Islamic concepts, symbols, and discourses change across different geographies and time periods. In our explorations, we are particularly interested in (1) cataloging the vast diversity of Islamic expressions in different times and places, particularly in South and Southeast Asia; (2) exploring how actors in these different regions and eras may make claims about 'authentic' Islam; and (3) exploring how language associated with these authoritative claims often presents Islam as unchanging. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Islam.
|#|RLST081  SC|^|Precol Afri Chrstian Spiritualit|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Precolonial African Christian Spiritualities. There is a widespread and unfortunate perception that African Christianity is a relatively modern phenomenon, that African literature began largely in the twentieth century and only as a response to European colonization, and that African cultures of the last two millenia have had little appreciable impact on the flow of human history. This course will upset these perceptions by drawing on an immense corpus of African Christian writings penned between the second and seventeenth centuries on spirituality, the body, and ritual traditions that were written as much in native African languages (e.g., Coptic, Ge'ez, Old Nubian, Amharic)as they were in foreign lanugages (e.g., Greek and Latin), and that transformed the contours of Christianity in ways still evident today. This course is designed to be appropriate for first-year students and will offer a basic introduction to critical methods in religious studies, including post-/decolonial studies, queer theory, and discourse analysis. |#|RLST082  CM|^|African-American Religions|^|MRLS|^||^|CM|^|This course offers an introduction to African American religions. The course moves chronologically, examining African religions in the Americas, cultural continuities between African and African American religions, slave religion, and the development of independent African American churches. We will examine the rise of African-American new religious movements such as Father Divine and the Nation of Islam, and the religious dimensions of the Civil Rights Movement. Moving through African-American religious history, we will consider topics such as slave resistance, gender and race, and emigration to Africa.
|#|RLST084  CM|^|Relig, Race, Civil Rights Mvmt|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|The course examines the influence of religion on white supremacy and the civil rights movement in the United States from the 1950s through the 1970s. In particular, it explores how religious ideologies, symbols, texts, and narratives were incorporated and employed as strategies and mechanisms for social change in the African American, Mexican American/Chicano, and American Indian civil rights struggles. It will focus on how key leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Cesar Chavez, Ralph Abernathy, Reies Lopez Tijerina, Dolores Huerta, Dennis Banks, and others drew on their religious ideologies, symbols, texts, and counter-narratives in their struggles against white supremacy, segregation, political disenfranchisement, and for civil rights and social justice. 

|#|RLST085  SC|^|Conquered Colonized Christianity|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course explores the history of conquered and colonized Christianities in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and America between the first and twentieth century through approaches that draw on gender, cultural, and post-/decolonial theory. The course engages Christian identity formation when articulated from political, ethno-racial, religious, or ideological vulnerability and raises the recurrent question: is Christianity in power authentic Christianity? Suitable for first-years.|#|RLST086  SC|^|Christianity,Capital & Communism|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course explores the ethical, political, and historical relationships between wealth, income inequality, and social organization from the earliest Christians to 20th-century communist revolutions in historically Christian countries (e.g., Russia, Ethiopia, Cuba) and beyond. We ask key questions, e.g.: Were early Christians communists? Are Christianity, ethics, & capitalism compatible? How do economics, sex normativity, & Christianity intersect? Are US Christianities imperial religions?|#|RLST087  CM|^|Israel-Zionism & Jewish State|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|The course surveys the history of the state of Israel, from its ideological beginnings in Jewish tradition and the modern Zionist movement to contemporary religious, political, and social issues. Two areas receive focused attention. The first examines the contrasting and sometimes conflicting Zionist ideologies and the legacy of these ideas as they express themselves in Israel from 1948 to the present. The second focus comes in understanding the ways in which Israel has defined itself as a Jewish state, the role of religion in Israeli politics, law, and society, and the challenges to this identity, including the multiple forms of Jewish identity represented in Israel (e.g., secular, Haredi, Mizrahi), and the presence of large numbers of non-Jewish, Arab/Palestinian, citizens.
|#|RLST090  SC|^|Early Christian Bodies|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|In this course we will explore physical religious behavior, understandings of the human body, and interpretations of bodily experience among early Christian men and women.  The course will emphasize critical analysis of primary sources, secondary scholarship, and contemporary theoretical approaches concerning gender, sexuality, martyrdom, pilgrimage, asceticism, virginity, fasting, and monasticism. 
|#|RLST092  SC|^|Intro to Early Christianities|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|Through study of ancient texts and monuments, this course explores the diverse forms of Christianity that arose in the first six centuries CE. We will pay particular attention to political, cultural, and social expressions of early Christianity, including: martyrdom, asceticism, religious conflict (with Jews, pagans, and heretics), and political ideology.

|#|RLST094  SC|^|Feminist Hist Early Christianity|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|Since the 1960s, feminist critical theory has challenged dominant narratives of Western history. This course explores feminist studies of early Christianity (ca. 100-700) as one historical arena that continues to be transformed by new theoretical modes: from recovery/"Herstory" to queer theory, feminist histories illuminate our ancient pasts and our modern desires. |#|RLST095  SC|^|Jesus,Paul,Early Chrstn Sexualty|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Jesus, Paul, and Early Christian Sexualities. This course investigates a constellation of early Christian sexualities and their relation to Jesus and Paul, arguably the most influential figures in the trajectory of the religion. We will examine a range of texts, beginning with early Christian writings about Jesus and Paul's own writings, up to the tenth century and written in an impressive array of languages (available in English translation), including Greek, Latin, Coptic, Arabic, and Syriac. Our outlook will be primarily driven by critical-theoretical methods for the study of religion, including feminism, queer theory, post-/decolonial critique, disability studies, and discourse analysis and will have one eye firmly fixed on how Jesus and Paul as figures and/or writers continue to influence society and sexuality today. |#|RLST096  SC|^|Eros & Sex: Antiquity/Byzantium|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course traces the relationship between eros and human sexuality from Greek antiquity (ca.600 BCE) through the middle Byzantine era (ca. CE 1100)primarily through a feminist and queer theoretical lens. The course will draw on material and visual culture and will include readings from philosophical, literary, and mystical sources that express queer divine-human and human-human relations and transgender identities.|#|RLST097  SC|^|Queer African Christianities|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course examines the premodern social construction of gender and human sexuality as inscribed in the texts and material culture of Christians hailing from Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Nubian kingdoms (Nobadia, Makouria, Alodia). Specifically, we examine how holy Christian women and men transgressed and subverted gender normativities through gender-queer performatives.|#|RLST098  SC|^|Queering Christian Mysticism|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course applies the analytical and conceptual resources of queer theory to a range of premodern Christian sources on mystical experiences of the divine that were penned by women and men primarily in the Ethiopian, Roman, Persian, and Arab states.|#|RLST100  PO|^|Worlds of Buddhism|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Worlds of Buddhism.

To meet intellectual, social and political challenges that included state persecution. Buddhist leaders poured their efforts into rearticulating Buddhism under a spectrum of approaches defined by two polarities: (1) conservatives who emphasized restoring Tradition and (2) progressives who favored modernization. We will look at the Buddhist adaptations to modernity, particularly the modern state, from the perspective of religious history, exploring how metaphors of "Tradition" versus "Innovation" can be used toward the preservation and revitalization of religion.

Buddhist leaders poured their efforts into rearticulating Buddhism under a spectrum of approaches defined by two polarities: (1) conservatives who emphasized restoring Tradition and (2) progressives who favored modernization. We will look at the Buddhist adaptations to modernity, particularly the modern state, from the perspective of religious history, exploring how metaphors of "Tradition" versus "Innovation" can be used toward the preservation and revitalization of religion. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: Any previous course in Religious Studies or Asian Studies.|#|RLST109  CM|^|Readings in the Hindu Tradition|^|MRLS|^||^|CM|^|This is an advanced, seminar-style course designed for students who already have a background in the Hindu Tradition.

|#|RLST110  PO|^|Death, Dying, and the Afterlife|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore various ways East Asian religious traditions deal with death and the dead. We will examine how the Daoist, Buddhist, and folk traditions of East Asia historically and currently address the question of "What happens when we die?" We will look at different ritual practices surrounding death, dying and the dead in their ongoing relationships with the living. We will also explore various descriptions of the terrain of the afterlife or postmortem world by critically engaging a variety of textual and visual records of China, Korea and Japan. Some of the topics that will be discussed in the course include the nature of the self, the function of funerary rites, the geography of the afterlife, communication with the dead and religious notions of salvation/liberation. By exploring a variety of narratives and practices regarding death and the afterlife, students will develop a rich and detailed picture of the relationship between the living and the dead in the East Asian religious landscape.|#|RLST110  PO|^|Death, Dying, and the Afterlife|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore various ways East Asian religious traditions deal with death and the dead.

We will explore the ways in which these social dilemmas correspond to public policy paradoxes that assign punitive consequences to target populations considered unworthy of moral concern. Students will also consider the ways in which Christian teachings and practices work together with societal perceptions and policies to reproduce punitive harms that cause individual blame rather than systemic accountability. Finally, students are encouraged to reimagine these retributive teachings and practices within Church and society to realize emancipatory visions for abolition and human flourishing, particularly for poor Black mothers.|#|RLST113  HM|^|God, Darwin, Design in America|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course explores the relationship between scientific and religious ideas in the United States from the early nineteenth century to the present.  Starting with the Natural Theologians, who made science the "handmaid of theology" in the early Republic, we will move forward in time through the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and Andrew Dickson White's subsequent declaration of a war between science and religion, into the twentieth century with the Scopes trial and the rise of Creationism, the evolutionary synthesis, and finally, the recent debates over the teaching of Intelligent Design in public schools.

We start by exploring screenwriting and critical theories about film, race, religion, gender, and social change and then how Hollywood has served as a vehicle for both affirming racial-ethnic stereotypes and/or challenging and resisting them in their desire to rewrite the visual narrative of American history. We analyze and interpret how film can function as a vehicle for racial, religious, political, gender, and/or social commentary, conscientization, protest, and reconciliation.

This intrigue has been reshapedbut not lostwith the advent of modern visual surveillance techniques. In this course, we will examine a range of manifestations of the solar eye, paying particular attention to the relationship(s) it bears to reality and the ways in which the solar eye operates in schemes both great and small of confidence and illusion. We will consider works by Plato, Foucault, Ellison and Morrison; documents in government policy; and movies like "The Fly," "Cube," "9" and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. (PRT).

Special attention will be paid to debates about the impact of religion on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, African-American and Latino Civil Rights movements, the Christian Right, Church-State debates, Supreme Court decisions, presidential elections, religion and political party affiliation and voting patterns, women, religion, and politics, and Black, Latino, Jewish and Muslim faith-based politics and activism.  |#|RLST155  PO|^|Rel, Ethics & Soc Practice (CP)|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Through direct experience, related readings, structured reflection and intergenerational discussion this course seeks to develop informed responses to the following questions: What are the religious, ethical and/or simply humane elements that motivate and sustain our social practice? How does our present commitment to justice become a lifelong vocation of participation and leadership in effective social change? How does our own personal development foster or inhibit our capacity to deal effectively with injustice? To what extent do factors such as class, gender and ethnicity determine our assumptions about the human condition and our own role in society?

We will address these questions in an intergenerational partnership of faculty and students from The Claremont Colleges, residents of Pilgrim Place (a retirement community where many have devoted a lifetime to service and/or social change agency) and other Elders similarly committed to social justice. This fertile mix of differing age perspectives, diverse experiences and our work together will culminate in undergraduate proposals for a three to nine month project of social change in the U.S. or abroad.

Between the sixth and seventh centuries, approxiamately half of the world's Christian population found itself living under Islamic rulers across an immense, three-continental geographical expanse from China to the Atlantic Ocean. This course will investigate how Christians and Muslims interacted in this new matrix of power. We will pay particular attention to non-military encounters-especially since these were less frequent than many suppose, and as such we will focus primarily on texts and material evidence between the seventh and eleventh century that point beyond the dominant "clash of civilizations" model to a more constructive, collaborative, and mutually-understanding model that is based on groundbreaking work in the field of pre-Crusade Christian-Muslim relations. |#|RLST169  CM|^|Christianity & Politics: E.

Neither gender, nor religion are straightforward categories, as the literatures on each attests and must be theorized as categories with particular histories and cultural contexts. This course will look at the ways in which "gender" and "religion" interact with various historical and cultural contexts to reinforce, contradict and also resist traditional notions of gender and religious experience. Attention will be paid to how religion affects experiences of gender; and how gender affects experiences of religion. More specifically, we will explore the way in which the intersection of gender and religion affects understandings, experiences and negotiations of religious origins, personal identities, religious experiences, agency, body shapes, images and disciplines, sexuality, race relations, cultural appropriations and power structures.

To explore the multiple relations between ghosts and the machines, topics for the course include:  ghostly visions and magic lantern phantasmagoria; American spiritualism and the telegraph; phrenology and the rise of the archive; psychical research and stage magic; radio's disembodied voices; and spirit photography and therapeutic light therapies; psychic television; magic on film.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|RLST184  PO|^|Queer Theory & the Bible|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will look at how the Bible can be read productively through queer theory. We will examine biblical passages that are central to prohibitions on homosexuality and the larger discourses of heteronormativity (constructed around gender, sexuality, class, state formations, migration, kinship, children, etc.) in which homophobic readings of the Bible emerge. We will also look at the ways in which these discourses and the identities they shore up can be "queered," as well as at biblical texts that can be read as queer friendly. This process of queering will allow and require us to approach the biblical text in new ways.|#|RLST187  PO|^|Queering Religion|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Religion is often queerer than one might imagine. This course looks at religious practices, texts, and traditions that defy the usual assumption that religions insist on binary gender divisions and heteropatriarchal kinship models.  Along the way we question what we mean by "religion" and what we mean by "queer." We consider how sexualities and genders are shaped in and through religious practices, texts, and traditions. We consider the intersections of religion and sexuality with transnational politics, ethnicities, cultures, and power relations. We consider how religious traditions can push back on received norms and create space for queer gender expression, identity, and sexual practice. The course will pay particular attention to how we research and write about queer religious phenomena. Letter grade only. |#|RLST189A PO|^|Contemporary Christian Theology|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|In this close reading of several Christian Theologians, each offering a different perspective, we will ask: How do they reimagine their faith as they respond to racism, misogyny, ethnic cleansing, and violence of all kinds? What is the role of the narrative and moral imagination in their interpretations of Biblical texts and traditional beliefs? Can we, whether Christian or not, find in their theologies strategies for developing our personal worldviews and our responses to the challenges we face in today's worlds?|#|RLST189D PO|^|Religion and Politics|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Separating religion and politics is a hallmark of modernity. Yet what counts as "religion" or "politics" continues to be a point of conflict. Does politics imitate or even rival divine sovereignty? Is politics possible precisely because it is distinct from divine sovereignty? Does (and should) separation protect religion from politics or politics from religion? What do terms like "faith-based," "free exercise," "establishment," or "toleration" mean? Do religious discourses like prophesy or love of neighbor function as socio-political critiques or do they, instead, depoliticize injustice? We examine how these questions show up in Western thought, through theological works, political theory, court cases, current events, and debates on secularism. While focusing on Christianity and its legacy, we also examine the effects ofthese issues on Judaism and Islam in their confrontations with Christianity, on the one hand, and the rise of the "secular" nation-state, on the other.|#|RLST189D PO|^|Religion and Politics|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Separating religion and politics is a hallmark of modernity.

The course will consider feminist critiques of religious doctrine and practice, feminist biblical interpretation, and feminist theological approaches to racism, capitalism, homophobia, embodiment and vulnerability, and ecological disaster.  Some time will also be devoted to the interface of feminist theologies with queer and trans theorizing and theologizing.  Readings may include texts by Mary Daly, Judith Plaskow, Delores Williams, Sharon Welch, and Marcella Althaus-Reid.|#|RLST189J PO|^|Prison Religion|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course examines the role religion has played in both creating and opposing the carceral state. We will look at how different religious texts imagine crime, punishment, justice, and reform. We will think about the connections and differences between religious practice of human sacrifice and secular practice of capital punishment. We will look at ethnographic and autobiographical writings about prison ministry and religious conversion as well as religious activism around prison abolition. We will also explore the legal, ethical, and political problems that arise when 'faith-based' social service organizations working in the prison system combine social programs with evangelizing.|#|RLST189K PO|^|Muslim (Auto)Biographies|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|First and secondhand accounts of the lives of Muslims, from the famous to the unfamiliar, will provide a glimpse into what it means to be Muslim. The accounts take the form of poetry, personal essays, hagiographies, biographies, autobiographies, films, documentaries. These various expressive mediums will function as a way of exploring how Muslims shape what Islam looks like as a lived religion. These texts will also be read for how local, global, cultural, and other contexts impact the ways Islam and Muslim identity transform and are perceived. In addition to weekly class discussions, students will offer short reflective writings on the readings and produce a final biographical work on a Muslim figure of their choosing.   Students will gain an understanding of Islam as a social phenomenon that is shaped by its practitioners within diverse social, political, and historical contexts.|#|RLST189L PO|^|Encountering the Qur'an|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course explores the significance of the Qur'an as both a scriptural text and a source of cultural and religious expression.

The modern age emerged with the development of the media in the nineteenth century, when relations between people, previously based on personal contact, came to be mediated by the press, as today they are mediated by film, television, and the internet. The writers whose prose we explore were fascinated by modernity and articulated salient insights into the human experience in media society. We read a selection of their major works addressing the problems of personal identity, social involvement, as well as relations between men and women, in a rapidly changing world.

This course explores the shifting representation of women in films across the twentieth century. The Russian Revolution of 1917 promised a radical restructuring of society that would ensure gender equality. How was this new woman represented on the silver screen? What roles were imagined for women in this new society that was often portrayed as highly 'masculine?' How did the changing political situation influence depictions of women in these films?

We will explore topics such as the ethics and aesthetics of writing about prison, the relationship between captivity and creativity, the uses of documentary and fictional forms, the sociology of prison subcultures, and practices of resistance. We will examine how the experience of imprisonment is shaped by categories like race, nationality, gender, and class.

How do dynamics between individuals and groups shape and reflect formal political power? Are power inequalities in daily life âpoliticalâ? What is the relationship between economic power, social power, and political power? How do gender, racial, class, and other inequalities inform political activity such as obeying laws and voting? Does the state respond to citizens, serve capitalists, or is it used by bureaucrats? Where and how do citizens engage in politics together and try to create change?  
Political sociology addresses these and other questions. Central to political sociology is the question of how power in society is constructed, legitimated, sustained, and challenged. With a primary focus on the United States, the first half of the fall 2021 version of the course will analyze group power and daily life (including #MeToo and white fragility), white nationalism and the Republican party, fascist politics, and the Democratic partyâs changing relationship to working class concerns. The middle part of the class steps back to examine the notion of democracy and the global eliteâs ability to coopt resistance through neoliberal ideology. Finally, in the last section of the course students will examine social movements generating radical challenges to current forms of inequality and political power, including Black Lives Matter, the #NoDAPL campaign at Standing Rock, Latinx political power, and the fight for a liveable climate future, specifically examining efforts to promote a Green New Deal.

Wokeness is a term created by African Americans and often used as a hashtag in piecemeal ways by
mainstream society. In this course, we will challenge the idea of what wokeness means, its early derivatives, and its true definition by examining mostly early 20th century to more contemporary African American contributors to sociology such as St. Clair Drake,
Dorothy Roberts, bell hooks, Tressie McMillan-Cottom, and Whitney Laster-Pirtle. Much of
African-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being "woke" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding. |#|SOC 110  PZ|^|Classical Sociological Theory|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines some of the most important and influential thinkers who helped create and shape the discipline of sociology: Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Gilman, etc. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate school.|#|SOC 110  PZ|^|Classical Sociological Theory|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines some of the most important and influential thinkers who helped create and shape the discipline of sociology: Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Gilman, etc. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate school.|#|SOC 114  CH|^|LA Communities:Trans/Ineq/Actvsm|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Los Angeles Communities: Use of case study approach to explore the interplay between economic and demographic transformations and community dynamics.

and atheist views have always coexisted with Black faith.
Historically, Black humanists have grounded their beliefs in an anti-racist social justice critique that was distinct
from that of European American secular humanists. For generations, African American secular humanist
inquiry has provided Black thinkers, activists, and educators with a platform to explore questions of race, ethics,
democracy, gender, sexuality, white supremacy, and capitalism; as well as global citizenship, American national
identity, utopia and dystopia. This course will focus on how these traditions shaped Black liberation, resistance,
intellectualism, and creativity. It will explore nineteenth century slavery-era critiques of organized religion from
thinkers like Frederick Douglass and Fanny Barrier Williams; discuss literary portrayals of skepticism by
twentieth century writers and artists such as Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Richard Wright, James
Baldwin, Nella Larsen, Alice Walker, and Octavia Butler; and examine contemporary twenty first century
secular humanist, freethought and atheist activism, scholarship, art and social media among educators, writers,
bloggers, and organizations who are challenging the dominance of religious faith in communities of color.

Case studies include Hurricane Katrina, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Fukushima, and outbreaks of whooping cough and Ebola. |#|SOC 189E PO|^|Sociology of Space and Time|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|This course explores the organization of space and time as fundamental features of social experience. It considers both in relation to dynamics of social interaction, social power, and the self, integrating classical and contemporary approaches. The course combines social theory with ethnographic practice and analysis to understand how space and time are constituted and experienced in everyday life. Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189F PO|^|Sociology Through Film|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Course draws upon in-depth analysis of films (both narrative and documentary) with the objective of illustrating and illuminating sociological ideas - including concepts related to interaction, space, time, domination, modernity, and identity. Students will be encouraged to use the films to think through fundamental questions in sociology and social theory. Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189G PO|^|Sociology through Literature|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|In this class, students will develop their sociological imagination (the ability to connect individual situations with overall patterns in society) and use it to critically examine different forms of inequality and the diverse ways in which social movements and communities live and contest such inequality. Students will accomplish this by analyzing a wide array of literary works, emphasizing those from historically marginalized groups (women, people of color, members of the LGBTI community, migrants and their descendants, low-income groups, and others), from a sociological perspective. The course is based on two key ideas: (1) that human imagination and creativity are key elements for any form of social change, and (2) that a dialogue between sociology and literature is an engaging and multidisciplinary pedagogy that will help students realize the crucial importance of listening to all voices; especially those of the groups that have been historically devalued or ignored. Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189H PO|^|Africa, Env't & Global Economy|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Drawing on sociology and related disciplines, this course explores how Africa and issues related to the environment can be understood in the global economy. We will use scholarship, media, and case studies from across the African continent and world to explore topics such as: environment and health; the built environment and cities; energy; extractive industries; commodity chains; food systems and agriculture; soil and land; waste management; environmental degradation; capitalism and environmental violence; posthumanism, indigeneity, and resource use; transnational environmental governance; conservation; climate change and climate (in)justice; environmental imagery, imagination, and political economy; and environmental futures. In so doing ,we ask: in a globalized world, how do gender, race, ethnicity, class, and colonialist legacies influence the questions raised and the solutions offered in response to African environmental issues? Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189I PO|^|Women and Power in Latin America|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|This course examines the obstacles women in Latin America still face in entering decision-making spaces in politics, the state, civil society, and the private sector and the resilience and creativity they show on a daily basis to counteract such patterns of exclusion. We will look at their participation in the diverse feminist and women's movements and the alliances they have built with the LGTBQ community, workers, indigenous, and Afro-descendants movements in the region as well as with allies in national and local governments and international organizations. Coursework culminates in a research project with written and digital components.|#|SOC 189J PO|^|Global Environmental Sociology|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|How do we address global climate change in an equitable way? What happens when species disappear? Why do dams in China affect us in the United States? In our sociological study of the environment, we will learn how questions like these and global problems we might be familiar with are connected to issues of race, class, gender, power, and capitalism. Through exploring topics as diverse as pollution, indigenous approaches to resource management, climate justice, and vulnerability to pandemics, we will look beyond technical and scientific aspects of contemporary environmental issues to their social roots and implications. |#|SOC 189K PO|^|Globalizing Participation|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|In this class, students will learn about the institutional innovations public officials and historically marginalized groups (women, people of color, members of the LGBTI community, migrants and their descendants, low-income groups, and others) have come up with in order to make public policies more inclusive around the world. A particular emphasis will be given to countries from the Global South, where most of these innovations are being created. Although Participatory Budgeting (PB) is the most famous of these innovations, the class will critically examine PB and many others as well as the multiple ways in which they have become globalized as different actors share them and/or transform them into international best practices. Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189M PO|^|The Medicalization of Social|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore the phenomenon of medicalization, or the process by which more and more of social life and human behavior have come to be understood and governed through medical categories. Readings will be derived from empirical sociology, intellectual history, and critical social theory including the likes of Ilich, Foucault, and Agamben. Policy responses to the coronavirus pandemic will be highlighted as an especially salient case study of medicalization.|#|SOC 189O PO|^|Gender and Embodiment|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Explores the cultural and political dimensions of gender,the body and society.

Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189S PO|^|Consumer Society and Culture|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|This course draws upon insights from economic sociology, cultural studies, and marketing studies to explore consumer behavior and the social dynamics of consumption. Topics will include the historical origins of consumer society; the meaning of brands; the relationships between consumers and firms; the role of consumption in identity formation; and the connection between consumer culture and media. Students will be encouraged to use course material to think reflexively about their own positions within consumer society.

As such, this class not only provides a reflective lens but also provides students with the opportunity to engage challenging and diverse readings as well as participate in active, stimulating and fun class discussions. Over the semester, students will have the opportunity to reflect on what you have learned in your sociology courses in three distinct ways: a) becoming an expert in discussing a particular social institution - either one you engaged or didn't engage at Pitzer; b) create and submit blog posts using media and quotes to our class Tumblr page (site under construction) - these posts will serve as a way of showing that you can teach sociology to the general masses and c) applying your sociological expertise to a real-world situation and make policy recommendations. In addition, our class meets once a week in which we will discuss poignant readings related to the study of social structure that not only focus on the lives of individuals within social groups but also more critically examines the social relationships that foster social inequity and/or foster social change. |#|SOC 199B PZ|^|Adv Independent Research/Thesis|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|Advanced Independent Research Project/Thesis: All sociology majors planning to write a senior thesis/research project must enroll in this class, which will serve as an anchor for your work-- helping you write your thesis/research project & guiding you through all the steps along the way.|#|SOC 199IRPO|^|Sociology: Independent Research|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Independent Research or Creative Project.

Is translation an impossible task? This course will first examine key theories of translation (Schopenhauer, Von Humboldt, Nietzche, Benjamin, Pax, Ortega y Gasset, Borges, Derrida) to help us think about the issues that surround the practice of translation. The second phase of the course will allow us to translate from Spanish into English parts of key literary texts by Asturias, Cabrera Infante, Valenzuela at the same time we compare our work to that of their "official" translations by translators such as Rabassa and Levine. Finally, we shall explore translation as a practice that often contributes to a history of inequality among languages and people from different ethnic backgrounds. Prerequisite: Spanish 101. M.

|#|SPAN134  SC|^|Indig Women, Represent, & Strug|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|Throughout this current post-colonial era, we have witnessed emergent indigenous initiatives that have sought to challengedominant social, economic and gender structures in Latin America. Among the rangeof approaches that study these initiatives, the field ofâindigenous feminismâhas remained an era of contention among indigenous and non-indigenous scholars as well as activists. The course will focus on how current emancipatory thought and practice led by indigenous women has challenged that the ethnocentric andhomogenizing assumptions embedded in certain critical perspectives and feminist traditions. This course will explore a broad range of interdisciplinary theories and studies (across the social sciences and humanities)as well as literary and cinematic representations that have shaped leadership and cultural analysis for indigenous women in Latin America, specifically Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Guatemala. Along with representation of indigenous peoples by non-indigenous critics or authors, we will also study initiatives of self-representations in testimonio and films in order to analyze how the use of different media hasbecome a key factor for conveying memories of struggle and for the ongoing reformulation of past legacies in the context of the neoliberal era. |#|SPAN135  PO|^|The Boom:Modern Latin Amer Novel|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Analyzes the coming of age of Latin American fiction and its debut on the international stage, addressing theoretical, political and cultural issues.

Caribbean) from a chronological perspective in order to consider how critical terms that inform the
critical analyses of literary, musical and performance cultures in the Caribbean region are shifting.
We will map these shifts from the working-class musical genres which acquired a national recognition
after been considered for decades as inferior culture. We will consider how the urban setting redefined the new Black subculture of drugs and marginality. The course will link reggaeton/raggadancehall with activism, and generally we will consider the issues of citizenship/ migration, and sexuality. |#|SPAN137  PZ|^|Strategies of Resistance in Lat|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course will examine different recent strategies of political, social, and cultural resistance in Latin American countries, from the cycle of mobilization against neoliberal policies and their effects in the 1990s and 2000s, to the new resistances against ineffectual systems of democratic representation. We will explore cases such as student protests in Chile and Mexico, womens movements in Argentina and Mexico (#NiUnaMenos, #NiUnaMas), as well as some of the contemporary tools of activism and resistance provided by the new global communication networks.

The moment of conquest will serve as a pivot as we trace a genealogy of indigenous cultural expression through these varied mediums from pre-Columbian times to the present, paying particular attention to alphabetized Nahuatl as a colonial tool of domination that complicates standard ideas of literacy. Against these ideas, students will explore, through artistic projects, alternatives to logocentric "literature." Coursework includes introductory Nahuatl lessons, paleography using archival documents, and translation workshops. |#|SPAN139  SC|^|Plants, Land, and Food|^|SHIS|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|Plants, Land, and Food: Community Clinic.
In this community engaged clinic, students will design a human-based project that responds to a need in their/our communities based around agriculture and food cultivation. In the first part of the course, students will identify and research a community organization that serves Spanish-speaking communities. Potential organizations in Claremont/Pomona include Uncommon Good, the Pomona Community Farmer Alliance, and Buena Vista Community Garden. In the second part of the course, students will reach out to their organization of choice and design a project. And in the third part of the course, students will carry out the project and then review and revise it. This process will help students to build humility and empathy as they address a need in their communities. A sustained engagement in an agricultural practice, in turn, will help students develop an appreciation for the land and sustainable land use. Conversations with the professor will be in Spanish and students will write four reflections papers in Spanish that document their efforts and address any challenges or breakthroughs.

film, journalism, music, and visual arts. Often seen in the headlines for its roles in the drug trade and the soâcalled war on drugs, and 
known for its telenovelas and beauty queens, its worldâfamous footballers and cyclists, and its 
coffee, Colombia has endured the longestârun armed conflict in the western hemisphere. It is a 
complex and diverse nation with strong regional identities, a dire history of partisan political 
violence, and skyrocketing levels of social and economic inequality. But, it also has one of 
the worldâs most progressive constitutions, which, at least on paper, recognizes the 
contributions of indigenous, afrodescendants and other minoritized groups and 
protects their land and their rights. In addition to exploring the historical roots of 
Colombiaâs armed conflict and its interactions with other global events and forces, we will discuss how Colombian cultural production has grappled with issues such 
as the rural and urban divide, developmentalism, race, gender and class relations, urban 
violence, political mobilization, displacement and migration, and extractive industries and 
economies.  The seminar will include opportunities to have discussions with Colombian artists, writers, intellectuals, and students.

We will also explore the place of indigenous peoples in Caribbean national imaginaries. Our studies of novels, short stories, political essays, films, and other audiovisual materials will allow us to analyze how the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality are "translated" into Caribbean identity formation both nationally and transnationally.

|#|SPAN159  PO|^|Multilingual Spain|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Language in Spain functions as a source of communal identity and a site of political contestation. Spanish is the official language of the State, and regional languages such as Catalan and Basque are "co-official" in their respective territories. In this course we will investigate the linguistic situation of contemporary Spain, learning a range of concepts from the field of sociolinguistics: language standardization; language maintenance and revitalization; language and identity; language policy and bilingual education; and linguistic discrimination. We will also consider the role that language has played in recent debates about Catalonian independence, the status of immigrants in Spanish society, and the relationships among ethnicity, class, and nationhood.

Latin America as a vast geographical space cannot possibly be comprehended in one class; therefore, excerpts from a variety of disciplines will be studied thematically in an effort to encompass a broad, but not diluted, understanding of the issues that have historically faced Afro-descendants in the Latin American continent. It will look specifically at the ways in which Afro-Latino artists have represented blackness and designed their own subjectivities and agencies. |#|SPAN163  SC|^|Pais Vasco or Euskal Herria|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|Basque people (euskaldunak) are considered one of the oldest indigenous ethnic groups of Europe; its language is a mystery.

The aim of this course is to introduce students to Basque culture from a historical, linguistic, anthropological, political and artistic perspective. As one of the most unique regions of Spain, it provides a fertile ground to analyze decentralized forms of knowledge. We will tackle issues such a nation/nation state, ethnicity and identity politics; sexualities and gender, tradition and modernity. The course will also examine Basques in the American diaspora.

This course reflects upon the premises and promises of interculturality through an analysis of literature, testimonies and films by mestizo and indigenous authors from the Andean region. We critically engage in discussions around prevalent ideologies of mestizaje and bilingualism, as well as address the politics of relations among cultures historically in dispute. Philosophies of translation will be key for the analysis of how these cultures related and struggle to coexist.|#|SPAN184  SC|^|The Image and the Word|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|The relation between writing, painting, photography and cinema might at first be viewed as a simple and familiar combination of visual and verbal art as felicitous interplay based on affinity and compatability.  However, it also generates numerous theoretical speculations with far-reaching implications for the theorization of art and literature.  The potentially frictional relations between the visual image and the written text are especially pertinent for a discussion of the artworks of many Latin American and Spanish artists and writers.

This assumption spurs the extensive introduction of numerical technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, into contemporary governance, policing, and marketing. Yet, numbers are produced by people. How do people decide what information should be numerically recorded? How do they choose how to interpret numbers? How do social and cultural contexts play into their decisions? Reading broadly across history, social science, law, cultural analysis, feminist, and critical race scholarship, we will tackle these questions by looking at the historical origins of numerical technologies and their contemporary social and ethical ramifications.|#|STS 179L HM|^|Human and Artificial Minds|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Since the Early Modern period, the efforts to automate human thinking were entangled with heated debates about what counts as "good thinking"; whose thinking machines should emulate; and whether the thinking of some humans is inferior to that of machines.  We will begin with Early Modern and nineteenth-century efforts in automating human cognition. Then we will proceed to the twentieth century, ending with the most recent developments in artificial intelligence. Throughout this course, we will pay special attention to the power imbalances surrounding computation innovation and how those contributed to the ways powerful white men have historically defined good thinking, intelligence, and creativity.

"Thereâs no such thing as neutral education. Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom.â -- Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed.  So many students (and faculty, and staff) have experienced higher education as a place of conformity, isolation, and oppression. However, another way is possible. Liberatory educators like Paulo Friere, bell hooks, and Sara Ahmed invite us to imagine classrooms and colleges as spaces of freedom, where raucous and rebellious communities co-construct knowledge together and use it to build a more just and equitable world for all. In this course, we will engage with these scholars and ideas, add our own experiences and knowledges to what they share, and begin to construct a vision for liberatory learning at Pitzer and beyond.  |#|WRIT031  PZ|^|Writing For Social Justice|^|ZWRI|^||^|PZ|^|What is justice? And how can writing be deployed to promote it? The prolific, 19th century intellectual Karl Marx stated that the philosophers have only interpreted the world. The point, however, is to change it. In this course we will read and write to challenge common assumptions about race, sexuality, gender, class, and memory, among others. We will write about relevant issues that are absent in a world dominated by profit-oriented capitalist ideologies. Our aim will be to construct powerful narratives about the overlooked individual and collective suffering and resilience
of marginalized peoples. Writing will be used as an instrument of active engagement and remembering to come to terms with the wrongs of the past to envision a more just socio-political order. Additionally, we will integrate multimodal platforms, such as podcasting, into the course with the aim of actively connecting with local and global communities for change. |#|WRIT100A PZ|^|Writing Center Theory & Praxis|^|ZWRI|^||^|PZ|^|"Good writers are born, not made" - so the common misconception goes.

In this seminar we investigate theories from writing studies to examine our own diverse experiences in writing. What does it mean to call something "good" writing? What ideological and cultural assumptions underwrite definitions? What can scholars tell us about why so many of us struggle with the writing process? And what are some strategies we can use to help ourselves and others grow as writers? Aimed at students interested in cultivating the habits of effective writers, educators, this class is both theoretical and practical in its orientation.|#|WRIT100B PZ|^|Writing Center Theory & Praxis|^|ZWRI|^||^|PZ|^|"Good writers are born, not made" - so the common misconception goes.

What does multilingualism mean and look like? How does the ability to communicate in multiple languages shape and enrich one's writing? This seminar will apply the many different theoretical frameworks that define multilingualism and examine our own diverse experiences with writing and translanguaging. This course seeks to analyze how language, culture, class, and identity affect our ways of communicating through speaking and writing, and apply strategies to help us make choices that build on our strengths and enhance our communication skills.|#|WRIT105  SC|^|Writing and the Liberal Arts|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|We'll investigate the rhetoric of arguments regarding current challenges for the liberal-arts curriculum, asking questions such as: What are the traditional liberal arts, and how are they being re-defined today in response to larger shifts in the culture? Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values
threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions. Assignments will likely include debates or mock trials on our main questions, analytical responses to the readings, workshops and reviews of classmates compositions, a mission statement for a liberal-arts college, and a defense or critique of a requirement at the Claremont colleges.|#|WRIT109  SC|^|Writing Studio|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this writing workshop, students develop their understanding of the academic writing process, including prompts and disciplinary conventions; invention, brainstorming, and prewriting; drafting, revision, and editing; peer response; critical thinking; research; and oral presentation. Students discuss academic genres and writing conventions as well as rhetorical framing and audience expectations of individual essays of any kind (including senior thesis chapters), which they workshop as a group. |#|WRIT110  SC|^|Introduction to Rhetoric|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course combines canonical theories and contemporary practices of rhetoric.  We will study representative texts on the arts and techniques of persuasion from the classical, renaissance, and modern periods.

We will focus on how dictionary entries and metaphors, instruments that define words by using other words, construct, and limit our daily perceptions.  We?ll dig into etymologies and trace the histories of contested terms and cultural keywords such as identity, gender, iconic, liberal, celebrity, and so on.  We willstudy how figures of speech evolve from the concrete to the abstract and how they influence the way we think about the world.  Throughout the course, we?ll consider how our commonplace terminology is historically loaded, seemingly determinate, and yet open to change.  To do this, we will read theoretical works by J.L. Austin, Raymond Williams, Marjorie Garber, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Guy Deutscher, and Elizabeth Knowles, as well as applied pieces by Annette Kämmerer, Jill Lapore, Emily Martin, John McWhorter, Leslie Jamison, and others.  Assignments will comprise a series of short analyses and a linguistically and historically informed essay on a single word.|#|WRIT113  SC|^|Prose Style & the Sentence|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This is a course about sentences. We will study how to appreciate and analyze them; how to expand and contract them; how to translate them from one register/style to another; and how to move their words around for rhetorical effect. We will read from a few style handbooks (with exercises), scrutinize sentences from a wide range of sources, imitate some major stylists, compose a couple of short papers, and even try our hand at diagramming sentences, as well as complete a course project. Mostly, though, we will take a workshop approach to crafting a wide range of sentences in which every word tells. |#|WRIT120  SC|^|Tech Rhetorics|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, we examine theoretical and practical approaches to technical and nonprofit writing. These overlapping subgenres involve presenting technical and expert knowledge to a lay audience based on the particular rhetorical situation of the project, a task that directly engages translation, aesthetics, narrative, and ethics. We also track the various ways our technical and philanthropic rhetorics rely upon and help normalize socially oppressive structures.|#|WRIT132  SC|^|Arts + Culture Review|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is a writing workshop designed to enhance your skills in the journalistic review. Focusing on reviews of food, travel, books, film, music, and art and performance, we'll read reviews from the best practitioners in each area as well as cultural theories of taste and aesthetics and discuss the politics of both. We'll develop our critical palates by doing tast tests and short critiques in class. Finally, we'll talk about the ethics and logistics of reviewing as well as issues of form. Assignments will include reviews in each area and critical responses to the reviews of others. |#|WRIT132  SC|^|Arts + Culture Review|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is a writing workshop designed to enhance your skills in the journalistic review.

Course work includes one academic paper, weekly critical reading responses, social media posts across a variety of platforms, a final social media project, and an electronic portfolio of all work at the end of the term. |#|WRIT137  SC|^|The Newspaper Op-Ed|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Intermediate Argument: The Newspaper Editorial
This is a workshop-based course designed to enhance students' skills in crafting arguments about contemporary political and ethical problems and to develop their awareness of language's possibilities. We will examine the editorial as the most economical and condensed example of argumentative writing that exploits the full range of rhetorical techniques. We will read editorials on a variety of topics (some chosen by the class). For these readings, our main task will be to scrutinize each argument's logic and its author's strategies to gain credibility. Assignments will include exercises on logic and logical flaws, imitations of prose styles, and a portfolio of editorials. |#|WRIT137  SC|^|The Newspaper Op-Ed|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Intermediate Argument: The Newspaper Editorial

A writing class focused on the rhetoric of the current election. We'll investigate how the language of candidates and ballot proposals tries to persuade us. Our primary texts will likely include the Voter Information Guide, political ads, debates, and speeches.  We'll also consider commentary from leading political podcasts, some chosen by the students. And we'll study a few canonical writers on rhetoric and politics such as Raymond Williams, George Orwell, and George Lakoff.|#|WRIT140  SC|^|Creative Nonfiction|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This workshop-based course focuses on creative nonfiction, defined as prose focusing on actual events or circumstances in the authors experience depicted using the techniques of creative genres (fiction, poetry, drama). Subfields of the genre include literary or lyric essays, memoir, and literary journalism. We will read examples of the genre from highly regarded practitioners as well as more theoretical work, and we will talk about the ethics and formal conventions of working in each area. Assignments will include writing in each area of this genre and critical responses to the work of others (both published work and that of peers).|#|WRIT140  SC|^|Creative Nonfiction|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This workshop-based course focuses on creative nonfiction, defined as prose focusing on actual events or circumstances in the authors experience depicted using the techniques of creative genres (fiction, poetry, drama).

Themes addressed will include: childhood, violence, survival, memory, death, race, spirituality, generational difference, sexuality, class, and migration. Students should expect to take part in weekly discussions on assigned readings as well as to workshop writings generated in and out of class by their peers. Text may include literature by the following: Patti Smith, Sandra Cisneros, Dorothy Allison Eula Biss, and Miriam Toews.  For the Fall 2019 class, Miriam Toews is confirmed to hold a private class session with members of the course during her visit to campus November 12 with Scripps Presents/HBA Lecture funds. |#|WRIT160  SC|^|Theories & Pedagogies of Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is an advanced introduction to composition studies. Well examine influential essays from our discipline, mostly theory and case studies on teaching writing. In addition, well observe and conduct mock tutorial sessions, practice responses to student writing, and present and discuss examples of particularly good or bad instructional sessions.|#|WRIT165IOSC|^|Prison Writing Center Praxis|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, inside and outside students discuss the theory and practice of an Inside/Out Writing Center. Students read about and then practice various kinds of writing center pedagogy, prison writing pedagogy, and all aspects of the academic essay writing process. In doing so, they engage in nuanced discussions of the politics of academic writing, the English language, and college pedagogy; they also discuss studies of incarceration and of writing pedagogy in prisons, some of which focuses on the Inside/Out program itself. Assignments include prewriting, reflective writing, and essay-writing and revision; small-group peer workshop; full-class workshop; mock tutorial and debrief; discussion of readings; presentations; sentence-level editing; and oral presentation skill-building. 

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.|#|WRIT169AOSC|^|Classroom-based Tutoring|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, we discuss the theory and practice of a range of pedagogical practices that have been called âwriting fellows/mentors,â âembedded tutoring,â âclassroom-based tutoring,â âcurriculum-based tutoring,â and âsubject-area specialist tutoring.â In contrast to generalist tutoring that takes place in a writing center or otherwise outside of a classroom, with a tutor who works from a position of unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the essays they tutor, this kind of tutoring presumes specialization and familiarity. It also presumes a working relationship with the faculty member whose students are being tutored and allows group tutoring and workshops in the classroom. We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on literacies to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

This course requires at least one hour before and one hour after of travel time to our classroom at CRC prison.

Like detectives, like vampires, like geeks. In this course, we will learn to read as writers do, beginning with sentences and ending with the structure of novels. To do this, we will be reading a variety of authors - hundreds in fact! - looking at how they accomplish their storytelling effects and experimenting with those effects in classroom exercises. This will also be a workshop class, in which we comment on student work in the light of what we've discovered. Enrollment limited to detectives, vampires, and geeks. |#|WRIT197H SC|^|Spec Topics: Investigative Fict|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Courses under this number will vary from year to year, and will focus on a close analysis of a given genre (the essay, the short story, the poem, the newspaper article, the screenplay, the review) by an established practitioner of the form. May be repeated for credit. Offered one semester per year. 

SP19: Our focus will be on investigative fiction: a hybrid form of writing that is at once highly personal and deeply researched. This approach transcends genre, and can be exercised in writing that is otherwise described as the non-fiction, or documentary novel, biography, autobiography or autofiction. We will be writing two original texts during the semester, working under the influence of selected texts by writers such as Janet Flanner, George Orwell, Carlos Monsivais, Colette, Frank Sargeson and Chester Himes. |#|WRIT197J SC|^|Topics: Eye-opening Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|"Light on the walls of old houses, June. Passerby, open your eyes," said the poet Adam Zagajewski. In this class, we'll focus on writing what we see, whether it's through our eyes or other senses. What can it mean to describe? What magic can be wrought by translating the physical world into words? We'll work rigorously on short pieces of our own prose, and we'll read selected texts by, among others, Agnes Martin, Shirin Neshat, Susan Sontag, Esmé Weijun Wang, and Maria Gainza.
