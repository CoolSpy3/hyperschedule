Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.
|#|AFRI010B AF|^|Research Methods|^|SIDO|^|05.0201|^|SC|^|Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary field that examines the historical, cultural, literary, aesthetic, political, social, and economic experiences and knowledges of peoples of African origin in both Africa and the African diaspora. In this course, we will consider several disciplines, such as art history, psychology, and philosophy, and their intersection with Africana Studies. We will discuss how these disciplines approach Africana Studies and how Africana Studies scholars can employ disciplinary lenses. In the process of producing a research paper this semester, you will explore and select the methods for which you will conduct your research.
|#|AFRI014  AF|^|Unruly Bodies:  Black Womanhood|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|In this course we will explore and critically analyze representations of black womanhood in popular culture. Closely reading texts, television, music, comedy, and artistic works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we will think through some of the processes by which black women's bodies are socially, politically, and culturally constructed as dangerous, disruptive, and out of control. Another major goal of the course is to consider the various strategies black women take up to foreground pleasure, and various ways of seeing black bodies as healthy and adequate. We can do so by examining competing versions of 'black womanhood,' looking at how ideas about the discourse  circulate around the hegemonic idea of black women and black femininity as unruly.

Such thinkers and activists have linked their efforts to Marx, Lenin, and other central figures, while simultaneously molding Marxism to address the circumstances of people of African descent and infusing the philosophy with approaches from the Black radical tradition. The course will examine classic Marxist texts alongside Black radical contributions and interventions to deepen our understanding of racial capitalism and to illuminate possibilities for liberation that come from a Marxist praxis deeply engaged with important approaches in Black thought. |#|AFRI120  PZ|^|Black to Nature: Poetry & Thry|^|ZAFR|^||^|PZ|^|B(L)ack to Nature: Poetry & Theory

This course introduces students to poetic forms in relation to the subject of nature in 20thC African American poetry. Through the study of authors such as Lucille Clifton, Ntozake Shange, Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, June Jordan, and Claudia Rankine students explore formal aesthetic strategies of and practice writing free verse, vignette, haiku, choreopoem, blues, and spoken word. Through readings and research in Black feminist geography studies students learn the critical contexts of and develop an aesthetic understanding in relation to the representational politics of nature and gender in African American poetic expression.|#|AFRI121  AF|^|Africana Philosophy|^|MIDS|^|05.0201|^|CM|^|Philosophical thought and the philosophical cannon cannot be restricted to the 'great thinkers' of western history. This course will be a general introduction to Africana Philosophy. We will unveil not only that philosophy is more than the western world and has points of origin in other places, such as Africa, but we will also discover how Africana philosophy serves as a challenge to the integrity of integral concepts and themes in modern western philosophy; for example, the subject, freedom, the human, and even ontology. We will achieve these insights through a survey of thinkers, writers, and people who address themes such as traditional africana thought, black existentialism, black feminism, post colonialism, whiteness, double consciousness, and afro-pessimism. Cross-listed as PHIL109 CM.|#|AFRI122  PO|^|Black Women's Autobiography|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Examining autobiographies written by Black women, we will consider the function and role of autobiography in the fashioning of identity, the interlocking systems of race, class, and gender, and questions of identity, politics, and style. Our objective is twofold: first, to explore the autobiographical practices of Black women and the arcs of their lives, approaching autobiographies as both creative works of art and historical documents. Secondly, we will analyze Black women's autobiographies as models of the diverse ways available for writing one's autobiography. The course will equip students to conduct close readings, engage in verbal and written analysis of creative texts, and prepare students to examine the lives of others as stimuli for examining and representing their own.|#|AFRI125  AF|^|Afro-Pessimism Politics of Hope|^|MIDS|^|05.0201|^|CM|^|This course will survey the deep and dark history of dreams, accomplishments and roadblocks that have constituted and continue to influence the ways Blacks in America negotiate a compromised political position. Traversing history from the brutality of the captured slave, to reformation and Jim Crow, to the Civil Rights movement and the modern day reflections on the role of civil society, police, and entertainment; we will reflect on the desires, goals, and hurdles that Blacks have faced all the while trying to articulate a sense of freedom within a white supremacist regime by following two lines of political thought: a Politics of Hope and Afro-Pessimism.

|#|AFRI138  PO|^|Black Queer (After)Lives|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Toni Morrison once remarked, "Certain absences are so stressed, so ornate, so planned, they call attention to themselves; arrest us with intentionality and purpose, like neighborhoods defined by the population held away from them" (1988). This course attempts to pull from the margins the cultural and political expressions of black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. We will examine both the uneasy structures of black queer life and extraordinary strategies black people have developed for navigating them, discussing how black sexuality is made visible and invisible in popular culture, academic, and political discourse. We will examine representations of black queer poets, musicians, political activists, and filmmakers, in which relations between race, sexuality, and cultural identity are explored. This course will contextualize and expand black queer archives, including visual representations, poetry, autobiography, political essays, fiction, music, and film, with current interdisciplinary scholarship in black queer studies.|#|AFRI144A AF|^|Black Women, Feminism(s) & Arts|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Interdisciplinary seminar explores the ascension of intersectional feminism(s) produced by trailblazing Black women artists, theorists, and activists. Assigned creative and critical interventions interrogate the ways interlocking constructs of race (aestheticized moral ranking system), gender, sexuality, class, religion, and citizenship inform self-perceptions, social status, creative practices, as well as political and economic relationships of power. Situating contemporary feminist work historically, thematically- organized materials highlight key written and visual texts by the nineteenth century and twentieth-century foremothers. Students will compare and contrast strategies for living, thinking, and visualizing love-driven efforts to raise consciousness, manifest political and economic change, and energize social transformations across the African diaspora.|#|AFRI150  PZ|^|Black Spatial Matters|^|ZAFR|^||^|PZ|^|Human geographers have a long history of demonstrating how space impacts our social life. This course examine how geography impacts Blackness and Black subjectivity in order to deepen our understanding of how Black spaces have the potential to cultivate liberation.|#|AFRI190  AF|^|Senior Seminar|^|SAFR|^||^|SC|^|Seminar for Africana studies majors. Complements guidance of primary thesis advisor, by focusing on interdisciplinary research strategies and data collection methods; development of authorial voice for the interrogation of African/African Diasporan topics, notions of race and manifestations of racism. Emphasis on writing, rewriting and peer review. Minors require instructor's permission.|#|AFRI191  AF|^|Senior Thesis|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Senior Thesis. In the Senior Seminar, students will undertake independent research culminating in a substantial thesis. The thesis work will be supervised by one faculty member chosen by the student.

Normally, the project involves a set of short papers and/or culminates in a research paper or original work of substantial length based upon participation in a project or program, e.g. original play script, film or film script, or artwork.|#|AFRI193  AF|^|Senior Comprehensive Examination|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|In the Senior Seminar, students will prepare for the exam to be taken during their senior year.  The comprehensive examination consists of two field examinations that test the depth of the students  knowledge of Africana Studies. The student chooses two areas in Africana studies (e.g., history and literature) in which to be examined.|#|AFRI195E AF|^|Haitian Revolution|^|SAFR|^||^|SC|^|The rebellion of slaves in Haiti reverberated throughout the Americas and Europe, leaving its imprint on the world in unexpected ways. The slave revolts resulted in shifting migration, changing economies, and increased the number of insurrections in Caribbean islands and parts of Latin America. The birth of Haiti captured the imagination of the world in myriad ways, fueling positive and negative ideas relative to race and insurrection.  

This course examines the history of the Haitian Revolution and its impact on nations and communities both far and near. The selected readings challenge students to probe official and popular representation of Haitis slave revolts and the subsequent silencing of this history. This course also examines the impact of the Haitian Revolution on abolitionist movements in the Caribbean and the United States, and in the development of Caribbean radical traditions. In addition, we will analyze the concomitant economic, political and social changes throughout the Caribbean as a result of Haitis trajectory. ***PENDING APPROVAL***|#|AFRI195F AF|^|Transnationalism|^|SAFR|^||^|SC|^|Introduces students to key issues and theoretical debates surrounding transnationalism relative to communities of color, particularly the African Diaspora. This course also explores the connections between migration, transnationalism, and globalization, as well as contemporary challenges to historical borders and boundaries. Additionally, the course examines the construction and creation of a "global apartheid" informed by race, class, and gender, and explores the ways in which communities of color have crafted modes of protest and resistance. |#|AFRI195H AF|^|Feminisms, Racism, Anti-racisms|^|SAFR|^||^|SC|^|This course examines the ways in which path-breaking scholarship by U.S. women of color and Third World women has been central to rethinking theoretical foundations, and to new ways of knowing, understanding, and practicing politics. It focuses on scholarship that provides some of the most important critiques and analysis of issues concerning: race, anti-racism, human rights, citizenship, empire, globalization and social justice.|#|AISS001ALKS|^|Accel Integrt Bio,Chem & Phys 1|^|CJSD|^||^|SC|^|This intensive, honors-level course sequence, co-taught by scientists from different disciplines, provides an integrative approach to the fundamentals of biology, chemistry, and physics.

Four themes run through the entire course: Japan?s economic growth and development, its integration with the world economy, Japanese government policies and their effects, and Japanese economic institutions and practices.|#|AKP 007  PO|^|Japan in East Asia|^|PREG|^||^|PO|^|The East Asian region is perhaps the success story of post- World War Two economic development. First Japan, then the Asian Tiger economies, then China and the Tiger Cub economies all experienced periods of sustained economic growth that transformed their societies. Japan was a key player in transforming the East Asian region. As the economies of East Asia have become increasingly integrated, linkages between these societies have also become both deeper and broader. However, the region is also facing considerable challenges. Security issues are dominant, examples being the Korean peninsula, and territorial disputes. Environmental/ natural resource issues provide another set of key challenges. How do we understand these challenges and how do we assess Japan?s responses? This course will begin by outlining the prominent theories of international relations, which will then become the tools we use to analyze the important issues and challenges facing Japan in East Asia. We will pick up a number of prominent case studies from contemporary East Asia, and investigate from the perspective of Japan?s international relations. Importantly, we will be focusing on perspectives from Japan.|#|AKP 008  PO|^|The World of Japanese Cuisine|^|PREG|^||^|PO|^|This course will look at the history of Japanese cuisine and show how the country's obsession with eating well anticipated the global slow food movement and our age of celebrity chefs.|#|AMST103  JT|^|Intro to American Cultures|^|SAMS|^||^|SC|^|This class analyzes the histories and cultures of the U.S., focusing on the experiences of people and communities of color. Topics change each year and include race and racism; migration and immigration; and culture (e.g., art, music, film) across a wide range of academic and popular texts. This is the introductory course in the five-colleges American Studies program, but is open to all students. 

|#|AMST103  SC|^|Intro to American Cultures|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|This course, taught by an intercollegiate faculty team, introduces principal themes in American culture.  Its interdisciplinary approach brings together such areas as art, music, politics, social history, literature, and anthropology.  Topics frequently covered include the origins of the American self, ethnic diversity, immigration, women, the West, modernism, consensus, and dissent.  Required of all majors. 
|#|AMST128  SC|^|Race, Space, and Difference|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|This course is an introduction to critical scholarship on race and space in the United States. We will consider definitions of race and racism, and how the intertwining of race and differential access to space has shaped patterns of power and inequality. We pay special attention to the making and maintenance of national boundaries; spatial typologies within metropolitan areas; and the differential racialization of Asian Americans, Latinxs, African Americans, and Native Americans. Readings and discussion are organized around spatial typologies including border, ghetto, suburb, and prison. Assignments provide opportunities to think critically about race, space, and inequality in the landscape.|#|AMST130  SC|^|Cold War Taiwanese/America|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|This course examines Taiwanese/American history, identity, politics, and culture with a particular focus on global Cold War politics and the historical relationship between Taiwan and the United States. Through film, literature, popular culture, primary historical texts, and interdisciplinary scholarship, students will use the focus on Taiwan and the United States to develop a broad understanding of issues including student migration, cultural identity, diasporic activism, imperialism and colonialism, and people and places caught in the crosshairs of global hegemony.|#|AMST133  SC|^|Reproductive Justice|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|From the forced sterilization of poor, nonwhite, and disabled women to current debates over abortion rights, and over federal-vs-states approaches to reproductive policy, reproductive health has long been a matter of social justice. Within the last fifteen years, there has been a shift from the women's movement emphasis on ?choice? (which presumes a fully capacitated and autonomous individual with access to all options) to the concept of reproductive ?justice,? which argues that reproductive choices are embedded within systems of inequality based on race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and immigrant status. In this course, students will gain an overview of the historical perspectives and policies concerning reproductive justice. They will become acquainted with statistical information, qualitative narratives, policies, laws, propositions, and social-movement narratives. The emphasis will be on reproductive justice, especially concerning socio-economic, racial, ethnic, and gender inequality, as well as on matters of repro-normativity, which intersect with heteronormativity to regulate the reproductive options of sexual minorities and gender non-conforming people (LGBTQIA).|#|AMST179A HM|^|Star Trek, Race, Gender, & Class|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course will use a historical survey of the Star Trek science fiction television franchise as point of departure and return for understanding influential, challenging texts in Marxist, critical-race, postcolonial, feminist, queer, affect, and other domains of social and cultural theory, and for examining the contradictions of post-World War II U.S. cultures and politics. Whether we read Star Trek as a queer-feminist post-scarcity utopia, a patriarchal colonial fantasy, or both, it offers ample allegorical resources for social critique and for imagining alternative futures. Familiarity with the Star Trek franchise is not a prerequisite.|#|AMST180  PO|^|American Studies Seminar|^|PAMS|^||^|PO|^|American Studies Seminar.

cultural context. Students will become familiar with basic concepts and qualitative methods in the 
social sciences, including ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of face-to-face communication. 
We look for ways of answering questions such as these:

 How do everyday conversational practices create solidarity between people, or set them apart from 
one another? How does talk reflect and create relations of power?
 How do words combine with other semiotic modalities (gesture, facial expression, prosody) to 
convey subtle messages?
 Why do miscommunications arise, even between people who speak the same language?
 How do children learn to speak not only grammatically, but also appropriately?
 How does language shape our thoughts or the ways we perceive the world?

In this course, we explore language  as a complex form of social actionnot merely a vehicle for 
communicating thoughts and meanings, but a means of creating the social world. We consider ways 
that language acts on us, and ways that we act through language: achieving relationships, 
constituting identities, constructing norms and patterns of thought, and positioning ourselves and 
others in relation to global systems of power and inequality.

Anthropology of Latin America.
Latin America is among the most extensively studied regions by anthropologists worldwide. This course surveys some of the main themes in The Anthropology of Latin America, through the close reading of several ethnographies on the region. We will critically examine topics including: gender, sexuality, violence, indigenous rights, difference, and marginality. Staff.
|#|ANTH022  SC|^|Urban East Asia|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Contemporary mega cities in East Asia have undergone increasingly intense socioeconomic and spatial reconstruction in recent decades. These cities not only show the various processes of modernization, urbanization and globalization in locally specific contexts, but also have become new models of urbanism themselves. Drawing on various ethnographies, films, and theoretical perspectives, the course highlights the lived experiences of diverse groups and the spatial forms that produce the dynamic landscape of the cities.|#|ANTH025  SC|^|Contemporary Middle East|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Drawing on a variety of ethnographies, films, and theoretical perspectives, this course simultaneously provides an overview of the Middle East (broadly defined) from an anthropological perspective and a critical exploration of the ways anthropology has contributed to the construction of the Middle East as a region in the first place.  
|#|ANTH047  PO|^|Economic Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|From "diversity management" in the workplace to the "Ministry of McKinsey" that dominates various Gulf monarchies, the discourses, rhetorics, visions, and recommendations of consultants proliferate globally as we careen from one endless crisis to another. This course will explore the histories, aesthetics, affects, and logics that have produced this shadowy, yet cheerful figure of "the consultant". Critically, the course also explores how the figure of the consultant transforms ideas of knowledge-production, political responsibility, urban forms, imperialism, and ideas of the future. Throughout the course, students will explore forms of expertise, new office cultures, the work of public relations, optimization, and design. While the proximity of the consultant to the anthropologist is of particular interest, students will read widely across different academic disciplines which include critical architecture, art history, literature, histories of capitalism, media and technology studies.  The course will also consider how the figure of "the consultant" takes up, but is also taken up by cinema, literature, memes, and contemporary art.|#|ANTH053  PO|^|Language and Globalization|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Through readings, films, and podcasts, this course covers how language and human movement have been intertwined over time, from early human dispersals through modern migrations. A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay, and it culminates in the student presenting an oral piece (resembling a TED Talk) to their peers on a research topic of their choosing. |#|ANTH055  PZ|^|Reproductive Justice|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|This course draws on ethnographic, theoretical, and popular sources to examine the concept of reproductive justice and the social, cultural, and political forces that shape reproduction in the US and globally. Course topics include abortion politics and access; obstetric violence; reproduction in connection to racial justice, disability justice, and LGBTQ+ rights; reproductive health activism and policy in cross-cultural perspective.|#|ANTH070  PZ|^|Psychological Anthropology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the way emotions, cognition and motivations are shaped by culture. Topics will include cultural differences in child rearing and conceptions of the life course, whether there are any universal emotions, cultural models analysis, dreams, and mental illness cross-culturally.|#|ANTH080  PO|^|The Horror of Everyday Life|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Anthropology takes the familiar and makes it strange. An echo of this is contained in the horror genre. Indeed, much of contemporary horror hinges on an interruption to the everyday, where the impossible becomes possible. This course will explore the proximity of "horror" to the discipline of anthropology. Rejecting cannibal exploitation, folk horror, and the destination horror of the vampire's castle, this course will explore how affects and atmospheres of horror emerge from everyday life. The course will proceed through a pairing of film and anthropological commentaries on topics like race, gender and sexuality, science and technology, and the body and medicine. Students will elaborate on key concepts like the uncanny, terror, and horror, taking seriously their social and political effects on our everyday lives.|#|ANTH087  SC|^|Contemp Issues: Gender & Islam|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This course explains a variety of issues significant to the study of gender and Islam in different contexts, which may include the Middle East, South Asia, Africa and the U.S. Various Islamic constructions and interpretations of gender, masculinity and femininity, sexuality, and human nature will be critically examined.|#|ANTH097G SC|^|Political Anthropology|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This course examines politics and power from an anthropological perspective. It explores the impact of the recognition of the importance of colonialism and capitalism on political anthropology; new ways of understanding "formal" and everyday forms of power, domination and resistance; and globalization in relation to identity, the state and political action. 
|#|ANTH099  PZ|^|China 21st Century|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|In the 21st century China is among the worldâs most powerful nations and yet remains a country of stark economic contrasts. This class will examine the social, cultural, and political consequences of Chinaâs global prominence. Particular attention will be paid to national discourse, resources distribution, generational differences, labor, consumer and internet culture, sex and gender, ethnic groups, the Coronavirus pandemic, and projects of building global infrastructure. The class is a seminar that will combine short lectures with discussions based on the close reading of articles by journalists, anthropologists, and historians. |#|ANTH100  PO|^|Anthropology of Sound|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|From reflecting on the ethics of listening to religious cassettes in Egypt to listening with oceanographers as they use sound to know and to navigate, anthropologists increasingly do ethnography with their ears. This new research represents a conscious democratization of the senses. This course provides a survey of the anthropology of sound while asking students to imagine futures for sound ethnography through praxis. We will examine how sound 'and music' are perceived, produced, disciplined, and silenced across cultures. In doing so, we will read ethnography, philosophy and sound studies to understand how sound relates to perception, space, politics, and culture. Letter grade only.|#|ANTH101  PO|^|Archaeological Theory|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Archaeology is one of the four primary subdivisions of Anthropology. The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior. Letter grade only.|#|ANTH102  PO|^|Applied Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course is designed to provide an overview of the field of applied anthropology. Introduction to the history, theory and methodology; uses of anthropology to solve social, economic, health and development problems, domestically and internationally. Students will conduct their own fieldwork on an applied issue of their choice.|#|ANTH104  PO|^|Linguistic Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course provides an intensive introduction to selected theories, methods, and themes in linguistic anthropology, one of the discipline's four subfields. The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists' inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.|#|ANTH105  PO|^|Mthds in Anthropological Inquiry|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Methods in Anthropological Inquiry. Introduction to ethnography, the major mode of investigation in anthropology. Emphasis on systematic inquiry and inference. The vicissitudes of fieldwork and what it means to learn about human ways of life using the technology anthropologists have developed to gather, record and use data.|#|ANTH105  PZ|^|Field Methods in Anthropology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|An investigation of various methods used in the study of culture, e.g., participant observation, key informant interviewing, linguistic analysis. Students will learn techniques of both collecting and analyzing sociocultural data and will carry out a range of research projects during the course of the semester.|#|ANTH107  PO|^|Medical Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Medical Anthropology. History, theory, methodology and application of anthropology in various health settings. Concepts of health, illness and healing in diverse cultural contexts. Critical assessment of conventional biomedical assumptions. Use of anthropology to solve health problems.|#|ANTH107  PZ|^|Medical Anthropology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|The course provides an introduction to the anthropological study of illness, health, healing, and medicine. It will explore the ways that understandings and experiences of health and disease are shaped by cultural meanings, historical processes, structural inequalities, and social forces. The course will consider biomedicine as one of many culturally produced medical systems, and consider the role anthropology might play in advancing health equity. |#|ANTH107  PZ|^|Medical Anthropology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|The course provides an introduction to the anthropological study of illness, health, healing, and medicine.

The course will consider biomedicine as one of many culturally produced medical systems, and consider the role anthropology might play in advancing health equity. |#|ANTH107  SC|^|Medical Anthropology|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Medical  anthropology  takes  as  its  central  premise  that  health,  illness,  and  the body  are  not  just  biological  phenomena;  they  also  take  shape  throughspecific  historical, structural,  and cultural contexts.  In this course, we will examine how embodied experiences of health and illness ?and the  languages  we  use  to  make  sense  of  them ?reflect  particular  social  and  political  arrangements.  We cover  topics such  as:  constructions  of  health,  illness,  the  body,  and  disability;  medical  institutions  and practices in social context; dynamics of care and caregiving; structural inequalities that shape experiences of illness, including diagnosis and access to care; public and global health policies as they reflect shifting assumptions about individual and societal health.|#|ANTH108  SC|^|Kinship, Family, Sexuality|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|How do cultures organize human reproduction and integrate it into social life? Because of the universality of biological reproduction, anthropology has used kinship to compare greatly diverse cultures and societies. Tracing the history of anthropology's concern with kinship, the course examines marriage patterns, descent, and family structure in Western and non-Western societies. It also considers emerging forms of kinship involving new reproductive technologies and queer kinship ties in a global perspective.
|#|ANTH109  SC|^|Rethinking Dev: Anth Perspective|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Rethinking Development: Anthropological Perspectives. International funding agencies like the World Bank, governing bodies, NGOs, and religious organizations use the word "development" to indicate economic and cultural progress. Aspirational narratives of development as a civilizational end-goal are used to justify billion-dollar infrastructure projects and poverty alleviation programs. But these narratives of progress overshadow the lived experiences of people on the ground. This course addresses the history and politics that led to linking development to economic growth and introduces modernization theory, critiques of development, post-development theory, and alternatives to development. Using ethnographic texts to foreground the experiences of people marginalized by class, indigeneity, gender, race and ethnicity, whose lives are impacted by development projects, this course views development through a critical lens and shows the urgency of alternative models.  Course meets Social Science general education requirement. |#|ANTH111  PZ|^|Historical Archaeology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the goals and methods of
historical archaeology, as well as the archaeology of specific sites. Its focus is North
America and the interactions of European immigrants with Native Americans and
peoples of African and Asian ancestry. Archaeological data are used to challenge
accepted interpretations (based on written documents) of such sites as Monticello
and the Little Bighorn Battlefield. We will look at early Jamestowns relationship with
the Powhatan Indians, the lives of Thomas Jeffersons slaves and other examples as
seen through the archaeological evidence.|#|ANTH112  PZ|^|Environmental Anthropology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|Environmental Anthropology: Nature, Culture, Politics 

In this course, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the relationships between human
societies and the environments in which they exist. Students will examine how human groups have
perceived, granted meaning, studied, shaped, used, transformed, protected, or destroyed different
ecological contexts. Alongside this, students will also explore how diverse ecological contexts have
their own role in shaping specific social worlds.|#|ANTH112  PZ|^|Environmental Anthropology|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|Environmental Anthropology: Nature, Culture, Politics

Seminar participants will critically engage a range of recent and classic urban ethnographies from around the world and conduct their own investigations. 
|#|ANTH115  SC|^|Stuff:Social Life of Commodities|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|The world is becoming overstuffed by stuff. This course explores the social practices and cultural meanings associated with the production, consumption and circulation of commodities. Drawing on ethnographic and popular sources, it examines global commodity chains and the relationships commodities have with identity formation, political economy, new ideas of health and morality. |#|ANTH116  PO|^|Anthropology of Digital Culture|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Technology from the wheel to the printing press has influenced identity, community and society throughout time. Currently, we are in the midst of one of the most significant technological shifts in human history because of digital technologies. Using anthropology as cultural critique, we will examine the new (and not-so-new) cultural, political and material practices connected digital technology. Topics covered include activism, identity, friendship, hacking, piracy, property, privacy, identity, labor, and embodiment. Course is equivalent to ANTH116  PZ.|#|ANTH119  SC|^|East Asia in Ethnography & Film|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Drawing on various ethnographies, literatures, films and theoretical perspectives, this course explores contemporary East Asian societies around themes related to global mobility and new cultural landscapes. Materials include anthropological approaches to emerging labor subjectivities, migration, the construction of sexuality through popular culture, and environmental crises and social movements.|#|ANTH121  PO|^|Science, Medicine, Technology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course will engage in critical studies of medicine, science, and technology from an anthropological perspective. Recent ethnographic research will examine configurations of knowledge and practice with special attention to social justice, community interventions, and the studying up of institutions. Course is equivalent to ANTH121  SC.|#|ANTH123  PO|^|Anthropology of Genetics|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course will provide an overview of how sociocultural anthropologists have studied genetic knowledge, practices, discourses, and technologies in different contexts around the globe. It will examine the origins of genetics as a field, its connection to Social Darwinism, and eugenics in the US and abroad. It will cover topics such as the ethics of gene-editing, cloning, and assisted reproductive technologies. It will examine sampling methods and informed consent, especially among indigenous peoples and other minority groups. It will address genetic ancestry testing, identity, and the new forms of sociality enabled by genetic information.|#|ANTH136  PO|^|Anthropology of/and Capitalism|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|What is capitalism and how can anthropology help us better understand how it shapes and is shaped by human experiences around the world? Anthropological theories like "the fetish" are fundamental to critical accounts about capitalism (like Marx's commodity fetishism). This class provides an overview of the ways that anthropologists study capitalism, raising questions about political economy, labor, the circulation of commodities, colonization, racial capitalism, structural adjustment and extraction, privatization and neoliberalism in our contemporary moment. We will explore how anthropologists have tried to understand capitalism as a political economic system from within, including through critiques of the "neoliberal university" and academic knowledge production.|#|ANTH142  SC|^|State & Society Latin America|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|In this class, we ethnographically examine how ?the state? takes shape in Latin America across multiple scales and forms. Drawing from the field of political anthropology, this course approaches the state as a cultural and historical construct, made through social relations, practices, and norms. We begin the course by tracing connections with colonial histories and presents, examining racialized and gendered projects of nation-state building, and unsettling notions of sovereignty. In the middle part of the course, we look to the work of government in practice: the production of bureaucratic and policy documents, the provision of state services like health care, and forms of state policing and violence. Finally, we turn to civil society and social movement actors making claims on the state and transforming the nature of politics itself.|#|ANTH144  PO|^|Anth of Environmental Justice|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course is a critical examination of the entangled political, economic, social and environmental impacts of mundane and large-scale infrastructures like sanitation systems that deal with sewage, recycling or trash, telecommunications, roads, bridges, electricity grids, dams, canals and others. By taking infrastructures seriously as processes that can be made to enable (or impede) certain kinds of relations or movements, as well as devices that can function as important symbolic projects, this class will raise a number of interrelated questions. What sorts of histories become apparent when looking at the emergence of particular kinds of infrastructures? How can we approach questions of environmental justice by studying the mundane infrastructures of daily life? Which communities are made more vulnerable to risk by particular kinds of infrastructure planning, and how can we address these questions using qualitative, ethnographic methods? Previously offered as ANTH189Q PO.|#|ANTH145  PO|^|Mesoamerican Archaeology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course covers the archaeology of Precolumbian complex societies like the Olmec, the Maya, and the Aztecs.

|#|ANTH184  PO|^|Migration in the Middle East|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Migration has played an incredible role in shaping the modern Middle East. The figures of migration are multiple, over-lapping, and unevenly arranged. These figures include cosmopolitan pilgrims, diasporic merchants, colonial agents, settlers, refugees, aid workers, laborers, soldiers, tourists, foreign experts, "expats", smugglers, pirates, and other highwaymen. These figures also have their own techniques, technologies, economies, infrastructures, and intermediaries. Moreover, to speak of migration and movement, is to also consider forms of immobility, the besieged, the camp, the maid's room, all those who are stuck, "not going anywhere", or otherwise waiting. Drawing from anthropology, area studies, literature, and cinema, this course will explore how these varied and dissimilar figures and forms of movement, migration and displacement shape "the Middle East" and beyond.|#|ANTH189P PO|^|Visual Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|The course focuses on the history and development of documentary film and the emergence of ethnographic film within the discipline of anthropology. We will begin with an overview of the use of visual material, film and photography in both anthropological fieldwork as well as popular documentary films of the early 20th century. While the formal and aesthetic language of documentary film is often taken to signal "reality" in popular understandings of the genre, how has this framing been challenged within visual anthropology? Students will learn about the changing relationship of anthropology to visual practices through a number of screenings, readings and lectures that explore issues of power and representation and the visual medium.|#|ANTH190  PO|^|Senior Research Design Seminar|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Planning and research design, literature review, ethical issues in human subjects' research; funds management and reporting; dissemination of research findings.

|#|ARCN198  SC|^|Independent Internship|^|SACN|^||^|SC|^||#|ARCT179A HM|^|Mat Act: Exper in Architec&Desig|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|The course explores how designers and architects are re-designing material processes in response to climate precarity. Typically we think of building materials as raw resources found in nature. Whether wood or stone, materials are often understood to be products extracted from nature to be utilized by humans in the building process. Such understandings of materials belie the complex logistical, ecological, and technological transformation that "raw" resources undergo in order to become material substrates for our architecture. This course presents a perspective of materials as a process (rather than a product), subject to design experimentation and intervention. Contemporary architects and designers are re-thinking building processes and systems in response to the warming planet, by integrating ideas such as the waste cycle intervention, plastics recuperation, physics of jamming, bioprinting, and material decomposition into building processes. By centering materials as a process (rather than a product), the course attends to human actions and human-designed systems leading to a materials transformation, reminding us that materials are not natural. Each week, students will explore a material process through case studies and primary projects by a contemporary designer, with ideas supplemented by readings, lectures, discussions, and potential studio or exhibition visits. There will be 2-3 field trips on Friday or Saturday afternoons in lieu of on-campus class meetings. All enrolled students must be available for these field trips, which are a course requirement.

Chinese philosopher Zhang Zai (1020-1077) defined it as "the one source of all things." This is one of many definitions given by Chinese intellectuals, who emphasized different aspects of human nature to present arguments on moral behavior, political philosophy, affection theories, human interactions, etc. This course explores how the question of what is human nature has been answered by philosophers from the fourth century BCE (when the debate first emerged) to the end of the imperial era, in the 19th century CE, passing through the challenges presented by the arrival of traditions foreign to the Chinese context, such as Buddhism. We will consider why the topic of human nature became a central one in philosophical expressions, and how varying cultural contexts brought out innovative redefinitions. By taking this course students will also learn to navigate major historical phases of Chinese premodern history.|#|ASIA082  PO|^|Confucius and his interpreters|^|PASI|^||^|PO|^|The legacy of Confucius in Chinese culture is overwhelming, inside and outside China. Within China, Confucius is presented as the father of the nation; Confucianism is described as a way of life, a philosophy, a religion, or all three combined. Outside China, ?Confucius? is used as a synonym with ?Chinese?, as in the culinary TV show ?Confucius was a foodie.? Who was Confucius, and what did he really say? In this class, we will understand how the legend of Confucius was created. While the course focuses in particular on the texts associated with his figure, such as the Analects, the Book of Odes, and newly discovered manuscripts, we will also study depictions of Confucius and discuss the philosophical principles associated with him. |#|ASIA084  PO|^|Thinking in Early China|^|PASI|^||^|PO|^|In Chinese history, the last few centuries BCE are considered the incipit of the Chinese philosophical and literary traditions. Indeed, between the fifth century BCE and the second century CE, we see a flourishing of debates, ideas, and discussions in all areas of knowledge: philosophy, history and historiography, religious thinking, medicine, law, and poetry. In this class, students become familiar with the words of ancient Chinese thinkers, their debates, and priorities. We will learn to interpret these debates, familiarizing ourselves with the ideas that were dear to ancient Chinese thinkers, further considering the nature of the written sources (authorship, transmission, etc.). We will focus on both transmitted sources and unearthed documents discovered in the last few years, which  have at times confirmed, at times challenged the established narrative.|#|ASIA190  PO|^|Senior Thesis Seminar|^|PASI|^||^|PO|^|Senior Thesis Seminar.

|#|BIOL187JLKS|^|Special Topics: Extremophiles|^|CJSD|^||^|SC|^|What are the extreme limits to life? Recent discoveries revealed that microorganisms are ubiquitous on Earth from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the deep, hot subsurface. While the most familiar are found in our temperate surroundings, arguably the most fascinating microorganisms are found thriving under extreme physical and geochemical conditions where very little non-microbial life exists. In this course we will critically examine how these extremophiles adapted to survive, how their activities affect global nutrient cycles, and what their existence may tell us about the origin of life on Earth as well as the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the solar system. Finally, we will explore the impact their discovery has had on the fields of medicine and biotechnology, as well as our everyday lives.

to examine how global trends impact local issues. Working in a seminar format,
students discuss how power shapes social and environmental problems, network
and coalition building, and political movements. The class utilizes a ï¿½cluster bombï¿½
approach to several topics, providing a theoretical and contextual framework
for understanding broad-scale public policy failures. Special topics include
environmental justice, immigration, homelessness, education, gangs, and the prison
system. We are particularly interested in links between exclusion and structural
violence, symbolic devises of Othering, the growth of a surveillance society, and
movements toward more just urban landscape. Several fields experiences, including
a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border, expand on course themes.

Yet, national discourse often falls back on stereotypes of Latino/as' political apathy. This class will explore competing definitions of political participation. By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino/a/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of "Latino/a" social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants' rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino/a social movements historically. |#|CHST144  CH|^|Latina/o Religions and Culture|^|SCHS|^||^|SC|^|This course surveys and examines the role of religion in the development of U.S. Latina/o identities, identities forged in the expansive borderlands of North America (including the U.S, the northernmost "country" of Latin America). Though narratives of Christian history will figure prominently, the course is not strictly about Christianity in itself, but rather Christianity in dialectical contact with its Other. The study of the complexity of contact between Christian and non-Christian (indigenous, African, etc.) traditions and practices will lead us to a consideration of the diversity of expression and thought within Latino/a and Latin American religious life.|#|CHST184D CH|^|Chicanx Short Fiction|^|SCHS|^|05.0203|^|SC|^|A wide compendium of short stories written by Mexican Americans, or Chicanxs will be analyzed, dating from the 1930s to the present day. Diverse approaches--historic, thematic, or regional--will be employed, as well as a focus on subgenres, such as adolescent literature or detective fiction. Authors include Daniel Cano, Sandra Cisneros, Jovita Gonzales, Americo Paredes, Albert A. Rios, Gary Soto, and others. Cross listed as ENGL167C CH.|#|CHST185B CH|^|Narratives US Mexico Borderlands|^|SCHS|^|05.0203|^|SC|^|This course explores diverse processess affecting U.S.-Mexico border culture and the way cultural products- in particular, fiction - critically respond to these processes. Twentieth-century border narratives allow us to explore and examine issues of race, immigration, gender, community formation, economic deprivation, and the urban experience through the critical lens of geographical theories on space and place, cultural studies, critical race studies, and from a human rights perspective.

This seminar analyzes how Chicana writers have negotiated with and against the symbolic inheritance (and the material social consequences) of four Mexican cultural icons of womanhood: La Malinche, La Virgen de Guadalupe, Sor Juana Inees de la Cruz, and La Llorona. Furthermore, the process of icon construction in Mexicanx-Chicanx culture will be explored by studying post-mortem respresentations of Selena Quintanilla. Cross listed as ENGL167D CH.|#|CHST189B PO|^|Indigenous Americas|^|PCHS|^|05.0203|^|PO|^|This course approaches the history of Indigenous Peoples from a transnational and relational perspective. We will use the histories of the Wixaritari (Huichol) in Jalisco, Mexico, various communities of colonial New England, and the Tewa Pueblo of New Mexico to understand the unique but interrelated experiences of these peoples and the challenges they faced amidst competing colonial, national, and imperial powers. Students will utilize some of these new interdisciplinary trends and methods in the discipline of Indigenous/Indian/Native American Studies to analyze primary sources collected from various archives in Jalisco, Mexico, Mexico City, and New Mexico.|#|CHST190  CH|^|Senior Seminar|^|ZCHI|^||^|PZ|^|Under the guidance of the seminar instructor and the faculty readers, students write a senior paper.

Yet anti-epic and anti-heroes often critique the values woven into traditional epic form. This course surveys the role of epic heroes/heroines across ancient, medieval, and modern times in order to better understand the changing conceptions of heroes: what kinds of knowledge do epic heroes produce and how does this knowledge relate to our lives? Along with screening films, we read epic poems (e.g., Near Eastern, Greek, Roman, English, German), novels, and critical theory.|#|CLAS012  SC|^|Greek Tragedy/Modern World|^|SCLA|^|30.2202|^|SC|^|We explore the strange world of Greek tragedy through a reading of selected plays (e.g., Sophocles, Euripides) and modern adaptations (plays and films). Why have these ancient plays been so influential? Students also learn about Dionysiac rituals, performance styles, theater archaeology, and reception theory. No prior knowledge necessary. Students will also have the opportunity to act out/direct/assist with scenes from ancient/modern plays. This course may count for either the Letters or the Fine Arts GE requirement, but not both.|#|CLAS019  SC|^|Classical Myth in Film|^|SCLA|^||^|SC|^|From Cleopatra's beguiling charms and Medea's torrid love affair with Jason to Homer's wily Odysseus, ancient culture still provides material for conceptualizing modern political, racial, social, and sexual issues as imagined in modern Hollywood films and European cinema. This course explores contradictions in the relationship between modernity and antiquity through a study of cinematic adaptations of ancient narratives; central to these discussions are the relationship between aesthetics and politics and the shifting role of culture from common ground to culture industry and beyond. In addition to screening films, students will also read plays, poetry, historical narratives, film criticism, and works of critical theory. |#|CLAS112  PO|^|Gender & Sex in Ancient Rome|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|How did ancient Romans understand and experience gender and sexuality? What can we know about how sexuality and gender shaped the lived realities of historical Romans? How were normative models of gender and sexuality constructed and enforced in the Roman world? Do we have evidence of counter-cultural activity or gender/sexuality-based subcultures? In order to develop our own answers to these questions, we will conduct a theoretically-informed exploration of the intersections between gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social class, and political status in the ancient Roman world. We will draw on literary and material evidence, including poetry, medical texts, architecture, and visual art. By utilizing feminist and anti-racist approaches and actively making thoughtful comparisons with our own lived experiences, students in this course will become a community of scholars engaged in a meaningful inquiry into gender and sexuality in Ancient Rome and today. <a href="https://romasexualis2020.wordpress.com"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>|#|CLAS113  PO|^|The History of Sexuality|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|Is sexuality a modern construct that didn't exist in the premodern past? Why does ancient Greece occupy center stage in so many artistic, literary, philosophical, and scientific explorations of sexuality?  How might the study of sexuality in the ancient Greek world enable us to better understand our own experiences?  In this course, we will trace the intellectual history of sexuality studies and draw on intersectional feminist, Critical Race, Black Trans*, and queer theory to imagine new directions for the field.  Participants in this course will become a community of scholars committed to critical inquiry, creative practice, and generating our own histories.|#|CLAS113  SC|^|History of Sexuality: Clas World|^|SCLA|^||^|SC|^|The ancient Greeks and Romans categorized sexuality differently from modern Westerners. This course focuses on same-sex love, an area of maximal difference.

Whether within the Assembly and law courts or out on the Street, Athenians were constantly arguing about their shared values and the political implications of those values. In this course we will read selections from contemporary authors (including Aristophanes, Thucydides, Xenophon, Lysias, and Demosthenes) as we explore the robust rhetoric and the real results of these democratic debates within classical Athens (ca. 594-322 B.C.E.). There will be a strong emphasis on critical engagement with texts and contexts drawn from across the Athenian experience as well as their modern scholarly reception. Letter grade only. |#|CLAS117  PO|^|Archaeology and Society|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|Who owns the past? What are the aims of archaeology?

In this course, we will work together as an intellectual community to deepen our understanding of ethical issues raised by the practices of archaeology, museology, and the collection and display of material culture. We will begin by studying several archaeological projects and artifact collections from the ancient Mediterranean, including Troy, Knossos, the Parthenon Marbles, and the antiquities collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. Students will then identify, research, and present relevant case studies of significant interest to the students themselves. By applying diverse theoretical models, including actor-network modeling, thing theory, decoloniality, and feminism, we will develop our own methodologies for the study of archaeology in social context. <a href="https://archaeologyandsociety2020.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>|#|CLAS117  PO|^|Archaeology and Society|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|Who owns the past?

In this course we will explore categories of transgression, punishment, and public safety in the ancient Greco-Roman worlds. Through study of ancient literary and material sources, and modern responses to them, we will ask such questions as: What are the rationales and social objectives of punishment? How does punishment factor into the public safety of a community? The course will be organized into three principal units: punishment and the divine; punishment and politics; punishment in extra-political contexts. It will examine how social order and power were constructed and maintained in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, and it will draw connections to similar issues of paramount political importance today|#|CLAS161  PZ|^|Greek Art and Archaeology|^|ZCLA|^||^|PZ|^|An introduction to the art, architecture, and other material culture of the ancient Greek world, from the Bronze Age through the rise of Alexander the Great. |#|CLAS190  PO|^|Senior Seminar in Classics|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|Senior Seminar.

The Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Humanities will be a central part of your experience at
Scripps College. The Core is designed to introduce you via interdisciplinary study to some of the
major debates and concepts that have shaped the modern world. The first semester of Core is a
broad foundational course in which students and faculty examine contemporary issues and debates
through a historical lens. Ultimately this course will serve as an introduction to contemporary
humanistic practice.

The current iteration of Core I takes up this task through an examination of crossroads. It considers
the constraints we face both collectively and individually. Often it may seem like we have no
meaningful choices left to make, so powerful do these forces appear. One need only recall the
political situation or global warming to feel an oppressive sense of helplessness; or, at a more
individual level, we may languish under the imperatives of social media or anxiety about success
in school (and, eventually, in a career). But are we truly without options? In addressing these

Raqs Al Sharqi is an introduction to a non-western tradition of dance improvisation, generated in a social dance context, but stylized and expanded to become a stage form primarily in Egypt and Lebanon throughout the 20th century.  The less stylized forms are known in Egyptian dance training communities as Raqs Baladi (dance o the homeland - a social form that is sometimes staged), and as Shaabi (which translates to popular dance).  Each of these also are names given to musical styles, and we will use music from these and other styles to train in the Sharqi style.  This class requires no previous dance experience, and is designed to enhance the student's creative and physical awareness, and familiarize you with the basic movement vocabulary used in this dance form, and with the musical forms utilized in performance.

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software. Letter grade only.|#|EA  100  KS|^|Global Climate Change|^|CEA|^|03.0104|^|SC|^|An introduction to the Earth Sciences, this course focuses on past and present global climate change.

|#|EA  101  PO|^|Just! GIS|^|PEVA|^||^|PO|^|Maps have the power to reveal relationships that are not readily seen, such as uneven impacts of COVID-19, global climate change, environmental pollution, and so on. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions.  In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equity.

The ways in which humanity has approached sustainability have not appropriately addressed this complexity in the past, bringing us to a critical place in the present. This course will examine the benefits and limitations of past and current siloed approaches, deploying the methodologies of transdisciplinary inquiry. The course consists of several modules of activity- and experience-based learning. Service-learning components will invite students to experience radical social agency, and promote empathy and community engagement. 
Topics investigated will include: contemplative pedagogy's first-person inquiry, bringing it into relation with the second- and third-person inquiry that are typically more valorized modes in academia; community-engaged performance projects and activated spectatorship (Boal's 'spectactor' and participatory action research); transdisciplinary re-framing; systems-level analysis; complexity theory; action research and applied research; and artistic/scientific integration. In addition to some didactic and theoretical presentations, every class session will also involve student work in smaller groups. |#|EA  126  PZ|^|Reprsntatn Mattrs: Wom, Pol, Env|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|Representation Matters: Women, Politics and the Environment

Since the beginning of time, women have influenced politics and public policy in local, regional, and
national settngs. This course will introduce students to women of diverse racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic backgrounds who have shaped environmental policy, public policy, and politics.
Students will analyze women's strategies to impact environmental and social justice policy worldwide
during this interactive seminar course. This course promotes intercultural understanding, social justice
and social responsibility.|#|EA  129  PZ|^|Environmental Law|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|This environmental law class is taught from a liberal arts perspective.
Its foundation is in law, government, politics, land use, and environment, but the course
includes art, urban planning, and critical theory. We focus on the politics of place and how
land use decisions are made, how they are deemed legal, how they create compounding
inequities and injustices, and then are further subject to legal efforts. We then examine
movements around countering injustices through legal means, utilizing creative and critical
theory approaches. Students will grapple with a legal and planning system relic of a more
stable environmental period, and we discuss how it is contested and constrained by
planetary crisis.|#|EA  133  PZ|^|Case Studies Sustainable Blt Env|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|Oral, drawn, photographed, and written analytical and projective (re)presentations of built projects and cases in digital forms of various types - individual and group work will be peer and outside-critic evaluated and graded in a series of assigned exercises. |#|EA  134  PZ|^|Sustainable Place Studio|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|This studio course will engage students in the integrative practices of design and planning toward the creation of a sustainable and resilient place.

What are the histories, cultures, infrastructures and aesthetics of the oil industry and how can approaching them critically help us envision different possibilities? In what ways can marginalized perspectives contribute to discussions and imaginations of energy justice and post-fossil futures? This course combines approaches from the social sciences and humanities to examine oil cultures and the different connections between the oil industry and the uneven distribution of environmental harms and hazards. Through engagement with case studies from all over the world, we explore the social life of energy, including topics such as climate change in the anthropocene, the history and social lives of energy systems, oil and democracy, oil and culture, petro-violence, infrastructure and environmental racism, electricity, plastic pollution, slow violence, greenwashing and corporate malfeasance, energy transitions, solar and wind power, and post-fossil fuel futures.|#|EA  150  PZ|^|Senior Sem in Environ Analysis|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|The EA senior seminar is organized around themes of climate catastrophe and conceptions of
our present and future. We examine philosophical premises about nature, culture, race, and
humanness that undergird perceptions of climate change, and we tackle how to deal with
climate catastrophe at personal and communal levels?as thinking, feeling, and justice-
oriented beings. This course requires readings, active discussion, and process-oriented
brainstorming and praxis work. We embody the principle of thinking through (and thinking
with) environmental problems by reading about the work of scholars and activists who
question anthropocentrism, and we create our own projections of what is to come. Our goal for
the class is to generate collective approaches for surviving and thriving even when the planet
is not/may not?this is what Donna Haraway calls ?cultivating conditions for ongoingness.?|#|EA  163  PZ|^|Chemical Pollution & Social Life|^|ZEVA|^||^|PZ|^|Chemical Pollution and Social Life

The present is marked by a ubiquitous exposure to different sorts of toxic
chemicals: from disasters that affect entire communities to the built environments
in which we live and work, from the traces of pesticides in our food to the
worldwide disrupting effects of oil production. This course will introduce different
perspectives and frameworks to think through the interactions between processes
of chemical pollution and social life. What forms of analysis and concepts have
been developed by social scientists in order to address the interactions
between processes of chemical pollution and social worlds? How is it possible
to account for the agency of non-human chemical elements in human social
processes and human lives?

The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting). The course will not discuss politics institution by institution. Instead, the objective of this course is to develop some habits of mind that enable the students see the world of politics through the analytical lens of economics.

Thus we assess the rationale for government intervention in the economy by analyzing the benefits of possible government policies and the response of economic agents to the government's actions. Topics covered include tax policy and inequality, social insurance programs, public goods, environmental protection, and the functions of nonprofits. Prerequisite: ECON101 CM.
|#|ECON189A PO|^|Population Economics|^|PECO|^||^|PO|^|This course uses an economic perspective to analyze demographic change, including recent dramatic changes in fertility, mortality and marriage in both industrialized and developing countries.  Microeconomic models are used to analyze individual and household decisions regarding demographic behavior, including fertility, marriage and family organization, human capital investment (health and education), migration, and labor force behavior, as well as many factors that influence or are otherwise related to these outcomes.  We will examine causes and consequences of changes in human populations (e.g., size, age structure, gender balance, health, wealth) using an economic framework. Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity.  Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level.  We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets.  Basic techniques of demographic measurement and mathematical demography are covered, with emphasis on hands-on analysis and presentation of demographic and economic data. Letter grade only.

The course will focus on the behavioral evidence itself, especially on specific formal assumptions that capture the findings in a way that can be used by economists. Economic applications will be used for illustrative purposes, but the course will emphasize formal theory. The class will be joint with CGU.|#|ECON190  PO|^|Senior Seminar in Economics|^|PECO|^||^|PO|^|Analysis of selected problems in economics. Required for graduation. Full course credit.

The fall 2024 topic is Asian Economic Development.

This course aims to introduce selected aspects of Asian economic development and the region's interactions with the rest of the world. The course is not descriptive in nature, and it is not just a survey of issues. Rather, the focus will be on developing simple analytical tools to understand key trends and macroeconomic, financial and trade policy issues that confront Asia in the world economy. Topics covered include sources of growth in the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) in East Asia, the rise of China and India and their impact of the global trading system, foreign direct investments to Asia, currency crises in Asia, Asian reserve build-up, Asian exchange rate regimes and issues relating to Asian economic regionalism.|#|ECON198  PZ|^|Senior Seminar|^|ZECO|^||^|PZ|^|The senior capstone experience refines our economic

|#|ENGL002  PZ|^|Narrative Arts for Soc Justice|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Narrative Arts for Social Justice

Through explorations of the narrative arts and storytelling focusing on the theme of
global mass migration, this class will incite students to imagine, motivate, and enact
social justice. How does narrative construct and make sense of the world? How might we
deploy the power of the narrative arts to infuse justice in our everyday world? How can
we connect subjective lived experiences and our digital identities? In this moment, when
selfhood is constructed by algorithms and history is driven by market data, how might we
harness the knowledges, technologies, and traditions of the narrative arts to rage against
the machine?|#|ENGL010  PO|^|Introduction to Close Reading|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as "close reading."  Close reading begins, not with the question, "What do these words mean?" but instead, the question, "What do these words say?"  And then, "What if these words mean just what they say?"  And then, "What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).  |#|ENGL010  PO|^|Introduction to Close Reading|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as "close reading."

representations of gender, class, race, sexuality, and other aspects of identity.|#|ENGL011A PZ|^|Survey Amer Lit before 1865|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Starting in the early 1500s and ending in 1865, ENGL11a surveys texts from the American
Hemisphere that participate in discovery, colonialism, and nation-building. Along the
way, we will see how violence and consumption drove Hemispheric-American narratives
of ?progress,? from the early Puritan settlements to the Age of Revolutions, and how these
same impulses bring about the internal fracture of the United States in 1861. We will trace
these patterns through texts by famous white-male cis-het writers such as Thomas
Jefferson and Edgar Allan Poe, as well as writers of color such as the enslaved poet Phillis
Wheatley Peters and the Mohegan writer Samson Occom. Through poetry, fiction,
oratory, memoirs, and drama, we will consider together how the literature of Early
America is intoxicated with its own promises and explosive implications.|#|ENGL012B AF|^|Intro to Afr Amer Lit After 1865|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^||#|ENGL013  PZ|^|Sci Fiction in 19th C America|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Science Fiction in 19th-Century America
Starting in the Jacksonian Era and ending in the early 20th century, ENGL013 explores how the technological changes of the 19th century (from the steam engine to early aviation) begat stories of wonder and terror that we now call ?science fiction.? In the process, we?ll discuss how science fiction often purports to depict a utopian or dystopian future, when in fact, it might be commenting (satirically) on the present. By comparing this course?s primary texts to contemporary science fiction works, finally, students will consider how the 19th-century works expressed concerns that continue to have relevance to American life today.
|#|ENGL015  PO|^|Poetry Starting with Words|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|A poem is a list of words, but it isn't only words. Although "it is true that many poems are constructed solely of words," according to the poet Barbara Guest, "we have all read these poems and we know that after we have read them we feel curiously bereft." This introductory course studies poems as words on a page, as sounds, as images, as ideas, and as artifacts. Examples from poems by Milton, Marvell, Pope, Burns, and Dickinson, as well as some anonymous ballads and riddles.|#|ENGL017  PO|^|Intro to Chicanx/a/o Literature|^|PENG|^|23.0101|^|PO|^|This course is an introduction to contemporary Chicanx/a/o literature. By reading poetry, novels, short stories, memoirs, and plays, we will map the myriad historical and political trajectories which give rise to Mexican American writing. We will analyze the formal elements of distinct genres adopted by a selection of Chicanx/a/o writers and situate these literary traditions and practices within an intersectional and comparative-relational sociocultural frame. Topics may include family politics; im/migration, citizenship; labor politics; borderlands and spatial politics; history and historiography; settler colonialism; community formation; cultural memory; race and racism; class consciousness; and gender and sexuality.|#|ENGL018  PO|^|Group Texts: Genres of U.S. Lit|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This class will offer an introduction to key terms and texts in U.S. literature in order to provide a grounding for more advanced study in a national literary tradition. Students should leave this class with a knowledge of many foundational texts in the field, as well as an understanding of the evolution of genre within the field. Key terms will include gender and genre, aesthetics and politics, race and freedom, domesticity and empire, nation and hemisphere, art, democracy and representation.|#|ENGL019  PO|^|Intro to Asian Am Lit|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course is an introduction to major and recent texts in the field of Asian American literature. We will examine the ways that U.S.-based authors of Asian descent use the formal elements of literary genres to articulate political and/or social critiques and commentaries. In our analyses of poems, novels, short stories, memoirs, and plays, we will map the myriad historical and political trajectories which give rise to Asian American writing. While our investigation of Asian American literature entails paying close attention to the formal elements of distinct genres adopted by the writers under investigation, we will also situate these texts within an intersectional and comparativist sociocultural frame and foreground issues and topics related (but not limited) to family politics; im/migration, citizenship; labor politics; spatial politics; history; colonialism; community formation; cultural memory; trauma; race and racism; class consciousness; Indigeneity; and gender and sexuality.|#|ENGL025  PO|^|Intro to Literary Nonfiction|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|What makes a work of nonfiction 'literary'? Where are the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, lyric and essay, memoir and history, art and information? This course will introduce students to a range of innovative twentieth- and twenty-first century nonfiction writers who have redefined the form. Authors to be studied may include Joseph Mitchell, James Baldwin, Janet Malcolm, Vladimir Nabokov, Maggie Nelson, EsmÃ© Weijun Wang, and Durga Chew-Bose. Students will have opportunities to write in both analytical and creative modes, producing their own nonfiction texts on topics of their choosing. Letter grade only.|#|ENGL030  PZ|^|Introduction to Creative Writing|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|This course will introduce students to methods of crafting poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction.

|#|ENGL040  PO|^|Kubrick and Authorship|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course provides students with an overview of the films of Stanley Kubrick from the perspective of his collaboration with and adaptation of literary texts and their authors. We will explore Kubrick's universe by watching his films closely and reading selected novels and short stories that inspired or informed his work, including authors such as William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Burgess, Diane Johnson, Arthur Schitzler and Jim Thompson. As we track the development of Kubrick's directorial style from The Killing (1956) to Eyes Wide Shut (1999), we will scrutinize his approach to literary adaptation and the relationships he developed with writing collaborators.|#|ENGL041  PO|^|Modern British and Irish Fiction|^|PENG|^|23.0101|^|PO|^|This course surveys some of the most significant trends, via some of the most important novels, in the 20th-century British tradition.

There are 1,274 registered tribes/sovereign nations on the continent today; this class looks at a handful of contemporary authors with varying tribal affiliations and expertise. We will be reading through a variety of genres from lyric break-up poems to auto-theory memoirs, experimental interrogations of coercive government documents, documentary poetics, mixed media paintings, country music ballads and performance scores. Some authors to be included are Layli Long Soldier, Billy-Ray Bellcourt, Demian DinéYazhi, and Diane Burns.|#|ENGL045  PO|^|African American Poetics|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|In this course, we will plot, puzzle through, and question the aesthetic transformations within African American Poetry from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present. We will consider artistic movements such as the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, Spoken Word, Hip Hop, and "Post-Soul Poetics". Since a definition of racial identity is complicated and multifaceted, it is important to begin with an understanding that the African American poetic voice is not monolithic. In terms of a poetic tradition, however, one could argue that the history of social and political struggle (Abolitionism, Civil Rights, Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, LBGTQ rights, and Afrofuturism) established an artistic continuum. This tradition is shaped by intimacy, a desire for justice, joy, transcendence from suffering, and the simple and complicated wish to be free. We will discuss religion, visual culture, politics, dance, music, and comedy. Rather than reduce African American poetry to a timeline, we will follow the echoes of history, analyzing how voices and themes overlap.|#|ENGL046  PZ|^|Intro to Creative Nonfiction|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Can I Get A Witness? Regarding the Pain of Others

I?ve often struggled with the limitation of what?s deemed a literature of witness. How are we implicated in the aftermath of crimes we did not ourselves witness? How can we best carry their stories forward, without appropriating them, without unduly calling attention to ourselves, and without in turn, having their stories displaced by ours? This class will explore innovative interventions on ways of looking through works by Saidiya Hartman, Cathy Park Hong, Muriel Rukeyser and others. And developing our own witnessing practice?producing original works of nonfiction in that sweet spot of up to 1200-2000 words|#|ENGL047  PO|^|The Literature of Gambling|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Narratives of gambling-in which the arc of a life may seem to depend on a roll of the dice-in comparative perspective, with an emphasis on various concepts for thinking about an unknown future, including fate, divine intervention, luck, hazard, chance, speculation, risk, and accident.

Primary readings may include Plutarch, Herodotus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Pascal, Defoe, Pope, Boswell, Byron, Pushkin, Balzac, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, George Eliot, Chekhov, David Mamet, Hunter S.

If, as in the poet Randall Jarrell's definition, "a novel is a prose narrative of a certain length with something wrong with it," then the novels studied in this course might be called, for their formal strategies or imaginative or verbal excesses, "prose narratives with more than a few things wrong with them." Making uncommon demands, they raise the risk/reward quotient for their readers (and, obviously, their authors as well), and exchange the usual consolations of fiction for the possibility of plunging the reader into an unforgettable experience, even as they beg to go unread or at least unfinished.

In this seminar we will examine how archaic "techniques of ecstasy" survived, more or less underground, into the European Middle Ages, as well as inquire more generally into the nature and status of inebriation, poisoning, and visionary trance states. To be considered: love potions in medieval romances; the relations between mystical experiences and plant-derived ecstasies; the use of hallucinogens (mandrake, belladonna, etc.) by "witches"; the history of medicine and alchemy; dream visions and astral travel; the pursuit of stupor.

Readings may include Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare's Othello, Donne's Songs and Sonnets, Cavendish's Blazing World, and Milton's Paradise Lost.|#|ENGL102  PO|^|Early Modern Romance|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will read from three major romance narratives of the early modern period?Philip Sidney's Arcadia, Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, and Mary Wroth's Urania 'with the ambition of building, from the ground up, a working theory of the genre (ormode' or strategy') called "Romance." Both partaking of and radically departing from the morefamiliar genres of epic, tragedy, and comedy, early modern "romance" has been described as the'kitchen sink' of literature (e.g. anything, everything goes) and it has been decried as a dangerouswaste of time. What would it mean to think of "romance" as a mode or instrument of inquiry, a tool of epistemology, a form or set of forms with which writers and readers of the early modern period came to know the world as it was, as it might be, and as it should be?  Topics include human and post-human; affective landscapes; allegory; transformation; gender and sexuality.|#|ENGL102  PZ|^|Aliens & Citizens Immig Lgl Hist|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Aliens and Citizens: A Legal History of U.S. Immigration
Stories in the news about United States immigration focus on ?crisis journalism? that give us little or no
understanding of legal or historical contexts. How do people immigrate to the U.S.? What are the
mechanisms and policies that immigrants have to navigate? This class offers an introduction to the
laws, policies, and history of U.S. immigration as we examine the cultural narratives surrounding
immigration. Knowledge of how immigration works and some of the historical and legal ?backstories?
will empower us to understand our present-day crises. The class aims to provide students with an
informed perspective on this important national issue so we can imagine what U.S. immigration
policies of the future should be in the age of climate change|#|ENGL104  SC|^|Intro to Poetry & Poetics|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course will introduce students to a wide range of modern and contemporary poetry representing an array of national traditions, aesthetic movements, socio-cultural contexts, and literary histories. Particular attention will be paid to the relationship between form and content. No prior knowledge of literary study is assumed or required; students will develop the skills necessary to read and interpret many poetic forms. |#|ENGL111  SC|^|Shakespeare Comedies & Histories|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course sets histories from Shakespeare's two tetralogies alongside early and late comedies including The Taming of the Shrew and Measure for Measure, focusing on aspects of the plays that resist easy generic categorization. We will consider the complicated relationship between historical fact and historical drama, exploring the challenges and opportunities that Shakespeare faced in putting figures from the distant and the recent past on the early modern stage. In analyzing his range of comic modes, moreover, we will observe that farce and witty word-play go hand in hand with incisive social commentary that is often not very funny at all. |#|ENGL112  SC|^|Shakespeare:Tragedies & Romances|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course focuses on Shakespeare's four major tragedies and on the four plays now known as the "romances". We will consider the influence of both classical and early modern revenge tragedy on Shakespeare, exploring the issues of governance and inheritance that are at the heart of his most famous works. We will also attend to the complex motivations of the protagonists who give these plays their names. In turning to the romances, we will consider how style and subject matter (as well as chronology) mark these late plays: should we read them as tragedies gone wrong-or gone right?|#|ENGL113S SC|^|Weird Shakespeare|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course seeks to expand students? sense of the Shakespeare canon by ranging beyond his most famous works. We will read lyric and narrative poetry as well as plays from each of the major genres, while acknowledging that genre was itself an unstable category for Shakespeare as well as his editors and critics. Our discussions will consider plots and characters that we?or the characters themselves?might define as ?weird? or ?wayward,? and examine how Shakespeare shapes and upsets our normative assumptions. We will examine the texts? transformations under different editorial hands, and explore the complexity of early modern manuscript and print culture. We will also study a selection of the literary and historical sources that influenced Shakespeare?s writing, and consider how more recent scholars and artists have revisited his work in new and provocative ways.|#|ENGL116  SC|^|Early Modern Outsiders|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course focuses on those positioned-by accident or design-on the margins of early modern English literary culture We will read polemical literature that has an explicit agenda against particular individuals or groups alongside texts that engage in more complex ways with racial, religious, and sexual difference. By considering famous Shakespearean "others" such as Shylock and Othello alongside authors who themselves lived marginalized or precarious lives, we will explore how different literary genres could both provide a voice to the vulnerable and be used as a weapon against them.|#|ENGL118S SC|^|Rhyme and Reason in Renaissance|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course takes as its focus the growing centrality of literary writing (and specifically poetry) to social, political, and religious commentary in early modern England. We will read texts by authors including Francis Bacon, Margaret Cavendish, John Milton, and George Puttenham with reference to contemporaneous works produced in different geographical (primarily European) locations. Our discussions will consider the role of humanist philosophy and pedagogy in shaping how prominent authors of the period theorized literary writing, and will examine their attempts to use poetry sometimes in making polemical public arguments, and sometimes in retreating from such argumentation altogether. |#|ENGL120A PO|^|19th Century American Literature|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This class examines nineteenth-century American literature with an emphasis on the theme of passing. We will become well versed in depictions of cross-dressing (men who pass for women, and women who pass for men) and depictions of race passing (black folks who pass for white, white folks who pass for black). This course will highlight the history and significance of race and gender constructs in early American literature. We will read fiction, autobiography, short stories, and we will watch early cinema.

We will explore, and sometimes explode, the myth of normalcy. No body is normal, even to itself. No body is ever one thing, but growing and falling apart in time. When we come to know that our bodies are perforated, what do we gain and what do we lose? How can a poem or a story unravel the contradictions between body, world, and mind, solitude and community, stigma and resistance, poison and cure? How does medical discourse limit how we think [about] the body? Students will respond to course material through creative writing and literary analysis.

|#|ENGL142  SC|^|The Early American Novel|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This seminar explores the development of the novel in the United States before 1850 with particular attention to the early national period. The course will focus on the relationship between the novel and early American political culture, considering how the novel's emergence in the US both shaped and was shaped by contemporary debates about democratic governance. We will consider the rise of the novel in the US in relation to the widespread anxieties about fiction, worries about transgressive sexual behavior, debates about female education, competing theories of national history, discussions of religious difference, and the struggle over slavery. |#|ENGL143S SC|^|Antebellum Lit & Pop Culture|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|The years preceding the Civil War saw both the emergence of a distinctive national literature in the US and the rise of mass consumer culture. This upper-level seminar will explore how popular culture shaped American literature: how this era's literature both grew out of popular culture and defined itself in contradistinction to it. The course will attend to such issues as the emergence of modern social movements, the explosion of writing by and for women, and the popularity of gothic and sensational fiction in the penny press. Readings will encompass both "classic" American literature and the ephemera of antebellum print culture. This course meets the senior seminar requirement for Scripps English majors (please see Senior Requirement in the English major in the catalog) but is open to all students.|#|ENGL145  SC|^|American Women Writers|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course offers an overview of American women writers of the long nineteenth century (1780s-1930s), with particular attention to the rapid expansion of women's writing in the antebellum period.

Formerly ENGL173.|#|ENGL146  PO|^|Asian American Poetry|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will focus on canonical and non-canonical Asian American poetry; particularly, how that body of work has been read, regarded, and taught, as well how it has been included or excluded more generally in American Studies. We will examine discussions and scholarship regarding Asian American poetry and poetics that have deepened in the last twenty-five years.  In addition, the course will engage with the emergent and established communities that have formed by and for Asian American poets from the mid-twentieth century to the present. This class will also examine and situate the work of Asian American poets as located both inside and outside a mainstream white culture. We will explore the poetry and poetics of Asian American poets from the second half of the twentieth-century to contemporary twenty first-century poetry, particularly following three categories of poetic form: narrative, lyric, and nontraditional writing.  This focus on form will include work off the page, performance, spoken word, and avant-garde work. Not only will the course explore multifaceted traditions in poetry but we will also look at both the theories of categorization and the politics that are always at stake for the poetries and poets. Letter grade only.|#|ENGL146S SC|^|Theory of the American Novel|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course offers a history of the development of the novel genre in the United States. The main focus of the class will be reading significant American novels from the 1790s through the early 20th century. The class will examine how these novels both participated in and were shaped by various social, political, and cultural developments of the long nineteenth century, including(among many others) the contest to define democracy in the early republic, the explosion of writing by and for women in the 1840s and 50s, the antebellum struggles over slavery, and the rise of modern social movements. The class will also consider writing about novels-from both 19th-century writers and later scholars-giving particular attention to accounts of what distinguishes "the American Novel" from other national traditions, especially the English novel. It will also consider the limitations of accounts that understand the development of the novel in such national terms. In addition, this course will offer an introduction to the subfield of 20th and 21st-century literary theory known as "theory of the novel." We will both consider how these theories of the genre illuminate the novels that we are reading and consider the ways in which these grand theories of the novel cannot account for the genre as it developed in the US. This course meets the senior seminar requirement for Scripps English majors (please see "Senior Requirement in the English major" in the catalog) but is open to all students. |#|ENGL150  PO|^|Visual Poetics|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore the rich and overlapping ways to read poetry and examine visual, performative, intermedial, artist's and textual poetics. We will examine how the term poetics derives from "poiesis", or "active making," and how both poetry writing and art making create textual and visual phenomenon. We will read 20th and 21st century poetry; we will discuss art works, installations, social practice and community-oriented public work. We will also write poetry, create artist books, visit our local galleries and museums, and meet with poets and artists who collaborate on art projects that push the boundaries of art and text. Prerequisites: either one of ENGL064A PO, ENGL064B PO, ENGL064C PO, ENGL064D PO, ENGL183A PO, or ENGL183B PO.|#|ENGL151  PO|^|Medieval Proof|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|What makes us modern if not our experimental disposition? We demand proof; we conduct experiments; we test everything: nuclear weapons, pregnancy, drugs, IQ, DNA, HIV and everything else. This, we think, distinguishes us from our medieval forebears. Still, what is more characteristic of the Middle Ages than their regimes of proof?--trial by ordeal; the test of a hero in a quest; demonstrations of the number of angels on the head of a pin. The purpose of this seminar is to see what-if any-difference obtains between medieval and modern experiences of verification. Keeping in mind modern and contemporary work on the experimental disposition of modernity (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Latour, Ronell), we will examine the reality probes sent out by literary, juridical, logical, theological, mystical, and scientific texts from the Middle Ages. To be considered: the failed tests of Perceval and Gawain; disputation and demonstration in the medieval university; Anselm's proof for the existence of God; torture; methods for distinguishing genuine revelation from demonic apparition; early scientific experiments; Ramon Llull's logic machines; the trial of Joan of Arc. |#|ENGL152  PO|^|Autotheory & Aesthetics|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|We will be creating our own semester-long exploration into themes connecting our writing to autotheory and aesthetics. Throughout the semester we will engage in discussions about the writing and performative self in creative writing: a rich field where we can track our art-making practices and their modalities. We will also be reading scholars who engage the politics of self-making and discuss the practices of close reading and varieties of readership. We will be writing weekly creative pieces in the form of poetry and prose and creating responses to the reading in the Sakai discussion forums and through class presentations.|#|ENGL153  PO|^|The Beyond of Language|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|It goes without saying that there is nothing outside of language. But the question is what sort of thing that nothing might be? And whether it can be known or experienced. In this seminar we will investigate some or all of the following: birdsong and other animal utterances; the grammar of colonialism; mystical languages of unsaying; the task of the translator; the transmission of the incomprehensible; the writing of the disaster; speaking in tongues. Although we will be reading ancient and modern texts, our particular emphasis will be on materials from the Middle Ages, that is, the last era before the capitalist schism that has led to the technocratic dream in which we now toil. Readings may include works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius, Anselm, Milarepa, Ibn Arabi, Chretien de Troyes, Marie de France, Dante, Chaucer, Margery Kempe, Nebrija, the Inca Garcilaso, Mirabai, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Benjamin, Agamben, and the anonymous authors of the Cloud of Unknowing and the Vimalakirti Sutra.|#|ENGL154  PO|^|Shakespeare:Comedies & Histories|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Shakespeare: The Comedies and Histories.

Consideration of various uses and modes of history-writing as well as intersections between religion and politics (political theology) in the histories.|#|ENGL155  PO|^|Shakespeare:Tragedies & Romances|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Shakespeare: The Tragedies and Romances. An examination of Shakespeares later plays, with emphasis on traditional and newly emerging ideas about political, religious and gender relationships, including the analogy between family and state and alternative notions of contract and consent. The course considers how the literary genres of tragedy and romance can perform political critique and imagine political reform.|#|ENGL156  PO|^|Milton and Visual Culture|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Milton and Visual Culture. Milton's poetry and prose in the context of visual culture: primacy and shame of the visible; blindness; iconoclasm; and "dissociation of sensibility."  Some attention to theories of image-making in other early modern poetry, painting, fashion, and design. Letter grade only. |#|ENGL158  JT|^|Ovidian Figures|^|CJT|^|23.0101|^|PO|^|Ovid's Metamorphoses begins with the poet's "intention" "to tell of bodies changed/ to different forms." This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one "body" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few) across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of "affordance" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the "vivid" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.  Previously offered as ENGL059  JT.|#|ENGL160S SC|^|Postwar American Poetry|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course will examine a variety of influential schools of post-1945 American poetry, including (among others) the Beats, the Black Mountain poets, the San Francisco Renaissance, the New York School, the Black Arts Movement, the Confessional poets, and LANGUAGE poetry. We'll explore American poetry through a variety of lenses, with the goal of understanding how aesthetic and social practices shape our understanding of the very category of American poetry. This course meets the senior seminar requirement for Scripps English majors (please see "Senior Requirement in the English major" in the catalog) but is open to all students.|#|ENGL161  SC|^|Futures of Asian/America|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course explores speculative imaginations of Asian/American futures, covering works of classic science fiction, contemporary popular culture, and newer work in "slipstream" literary science fiction. Central to our exploration will be the questions of how Asian/America is imagined as a contested site of future hyper-modernity, even as Asia represents a place mired in a timeless past. We will explore texts that speculate on transnational futures in relation to imperial pasts, on ecological disasters both global and local, on artificial intelligence and the "post-racial" futures, and more, paying particular attention to questions of racial information and the specific material histories of Asian/Americans.  Formerly ENGL180.|#|ENGL162  SC|^|Asian Amer Lit:Gender+Sexuality|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course will explore questions of gender and sexuality in the context of Asian American literature and will investigate how these key terms undergird even the earliest formations of Asian America. The course will investigate this idea through a variety of lenses, focusing on both creative and critical texts.

This course asks, What is writerly ?craft?? and What can we learn ? as writers and
literary scholars ? by paying attention to it? During the first half of the semester students investigate the literary history of ?craft? as a term of art. They study how it came to feature so prominently in discourse on North American creative writing in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. They examine how it became associated with particular literary styles, narrative structures, pedagogies, and notions of the creative process. And as they do so they consider what can be apprehended about texts, authors, and the publishing environment by attending to how individual writers have negotiated this term and the material conditions that gave rise to it. During the second half of the semester, this framework becomes the foundation for students? research projects, and readings related to those projects form the basis for a syllabus tailored to those research interests. Course formerly ENGL197S SC; credit not available to students who have completed ENGL197S SC. Course meets senior seminar requirement for English major, and meets Letters GE.|#|ENGL170  PO|^|Legal Guardianship and the Novel|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course examines the guardian as an evolving legal category, as a character populating that 'form for orphans,' the novel, and as a model for the literary persona of the novelist. Through readings in legal texts as well as novels by Richardson, Austen, Dickens, and James, we will ask how guardianship intersects with such concepts as ownership, representation, and especially authorship. We will explore the reader's role as ward, and we will glance at guardianship's bearing on histories of slavery, voting rights, and aesthetics, on contemporary problems such as mass incarceration and our failing stewardship of the earth, and on the novel genre's many debts to drama.|#|ENGL170A PO|^|Anglo-Am Literary Modernism|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The great modernist writers--T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, &c--were at the same time brilliant propogandists, creating the aesthetic system by which their works would be enjoyed. They also, along the way, created the first self-concious literary period. In this course we'll read fiction, poetry, and critical prose by the founders of Anglo-American literary modernism, looking at the values it supported as well as those it occluded--the voices it supported and those it made much more difficult to hear. Prerequisite: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL170F PO|^|Herman Melville|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course explores Herman Melville's writing across multiple genres from Typee to Billy Budd and including Moby Dick. Later emphasis on the superb novella Benito Cereno and short stories including Bartleby the Scrivener. Prerequisites: ENGL067  PO. Letter grade only.|#|ENGL170K PO|^|The Canterbury Tales|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Geoffrey Chaucer was a spy, bureaucrat, and mischievous servant of the God of Love who lived in London in the fourteenth century. Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality. No previous knowledge or experience expected.|#|ENGL170L PO|^|The Other Chaucer|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The fourteenth-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, a bureaucrat, spy, and initiate of the cult of Love, is most famous today for his Canterbury Tales. But among his other writings are: the first scientific treatise in English; an account of a meeting of the birds that he happened to overhear one day; a collection of life-stories of prominent women in history; descriptions of visions that appeared to him in dreams; and his masterpiece, the finely-wrought monstrosity called Troilus and Criseyde. Characteristic of all of the poet's works is an uncompromising irony; a filthy sense of humor; and, perhaps, a mystical knowledge of the true nature of things. This course consists of an introduction to Chaucer's language (Middle English); advanced analysis of his writings; and research into their modern interpretations. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL170M PO|^|Black Ecologies|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Following the working definition of ecology as the study of the often-intertwined experience of relationships among humans as well as among humans and nonhuman nature, this course examines Black literature that directly engages with natural and built environments.  We will read, write, and engage with writing, film, and visual art with a particular emphasis on the creative efforts of Black world-makers to expose racial capitalism and pursue environmental justice.  We discuss the cost/benefits of applying ecocritical, ecopoetic, and/or ecofeminist readings across  intersectional and diasporic geographies.  Writers such as Octavia Butler, Zora Neale Hurston, Randall Kenan, Ross Gay, Toni Morrison, and Jesmyn Ward will be read alongside scholarship of Lauret Savoy, Katherine McKittrick, Audre Lorde, Christina Sharpe, and Saidiya Hartman, to name just a few.|#|ENGL170U PO|^|The Faerie Queene|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This seminar is dedicated to Edmund Spenser's epic romance The Faerie Queene. Learning how to read the Faerie Queene is a bit like learning how to navigate a new dimension of reality, discovering a unique and counterintuitive set of laws and principles as you move along, stanza by stanza. Knowing that the world of The Faerie Queene functions differently from the one we more usually inhabit, we will ask: How does it work? What are its rules and first principles?  What are its boundaries and borders?  What kinds of relationships does it construct with the natural world and the historical world?  

This broad set of questions about the poetics of world-making will guide us through a variety of literary techniques and conversations, with topics including allegory, gender and sexuality, colonialism, instruction and play, form and discipline.  Our most sustained inquiry will take shape in a 20-25 page paper and readings will include recent accounts of the central aims and methods of the discipline.|#|ENGL171S SC|^|The Postcolonial Novel|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course will study the formation of a postcolonial canon within English literary studies through examining the form and content of the postcolonial novel. We will query the filiation between the form of the novel and nationalist narratives, as well as how the postcolonial novel has been commodified as world literature for Europe and the US. Additionally, we will attend to the way in which historical and political events from the postcolonial (or neocolonial) era are critiqued or registered. The syllabus will include texts by prominent and outsider voices from Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, and South Asia. This course meets the senior seminar requirement for Scripps English majors (please see Senior Requirement in the English major in the catalog) but is open to all students. Formerly ENGL188C.|#|ENGL172S SC|^|Queer Postcolonial Lit & Theory|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course brings together the insights of two theoretical fields-queer studies 
and postcolonial studies-and examines how race, gender, and sexuality have 
been (and continue to be) sites of attempted colonial control, as well as anti-
colonial contestation. We will read canonical texts in both traditions, as well as new literary representations and critical views from Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean. Students will study novels, poetry, film, and photography alongside criticism that engages nationalism, human rights, citizenship, migration, tourism, and performance.

|#|ENGL173  SC|^|Human Rights & World Literature|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course introduces human rights via the declarations and legal texts that helped shape them, and the fictional texts that have represented and questioned their violations. Our exploration of how "rights" (and "the human") have been defined begins in the West and extends to Asia, Africa, and South America. Formerly ENGL186.
|#|ENGL174  SC|^|Writing From Middle of Nowhere|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|Nowhere is not a place. However, particular landscapes (the desert, the jungle, the forest), geographies (sub-Saharan Africa, Appalachia, the Pacific Islands), and locations (rural America, and much of the Global South) are often construed as empty or cultureless. In this course, we will study the factors that construct a social and cultural hierarchy of place, and how and why various global ?nowheres? occupy a subordinate position to Western urban centers. We will focus primarily on writing about and from the Anglophone/postcolonial world, and we will query how narrating colonized places as empty, backward, or undeveloped served as part of the political project of colonization itself. We will also consider how domestic spaces are a sort of ?nowhere??where labor is repeated, invisible, and disappearing?and will query how gender contributes to visibility of place. Students will study novels, poetry, and films alongside criticism that engages urban/rural studies and postcolonial theory.|#|ENGL175  PZ|^|Gothic America|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|This course concerns the horrific and the macabre in American literature,
starting with Charles Brockden Brown?s Edgar Huntly (1799) and ending with
Upton Sinclair?s The Jungle (1906). Along the way, we?ll survey the theoretical
underpinnings of the Gothic, and discuss how the American experience
informed hegemonic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, while also considering
how authors such as Harriet Jacobs fought back against America?s horrors.
Race, sexuality, religion, science, and philosophy will figure in the discussion.
Together, we will explore why America remains a haunted nation.|#|ENGL175  SC|^|American Women Poets|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course looks at five poets including Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Sylvia Plath. Each of these poets has been extensively written about. We will consider how creativity is affected by culture, personal experience, politics, and artistic convention, reflecting upon the changes in critical appreciation of their work and recent approaches to their poems.  Each student will keep a reading journal and direct one of the classes.
|#|ENGL176  SC|^|Southern Women Writers|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course will explore the culture of the American South in terms of women participants. Topics include the role of women in the South, regional humor, the outcast, women's relation to nature, and other themes particularly appropriate to Southern women writers. Authors to be read include Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers, Lillian Smith, Alice Walker, and Kate Chopin.  
|#|ENGL180  SC|^|Seminar in Literary Theory|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course provides an introduction to literary theory, covering a wide range of critical approaches (Formalist, Feminist, New Historicist, Psychoanalytic, Deconstructive, Marxist, among others), and exploring multiple frameworks for the intensive study of literary texts. Formerly ENGL115 SC.
|#|ENGL181  PZ|^|Decolonial Futures|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Decolonial Futures/ Postcolonial Now:

From removing confederate monuments of the US Americanl college campuses, to removing Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town; from #Blacklivesmatter to #Rhodesmustfall; from the repatriation of stolen colonial artifacts housed in European museums to the very foundations of higher education- this course asks, "What is teh relevance of decolonial and postcolonial approaches to the present now, and to the futures we might still imagine?"|#|ENGL183  SC|^|Gendered Prose|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course examines how gendered literary conventions have shaped and constrained women's first-person prose across a variety of genres from the seventeenth century through the present, especially in writing by and about the Americas. We'll investigate how women negotiated these conventions within conversion narratives, captivity narratives, novels, autobiography, and essays. We'll learn about the methodologies and theoretical frameworks literary scholars use think intersectionally about how gender and power operate in these texts. And we'll examine how contemporary writers - including non-binary and gender-nonconforming writers - have grappled with this literary history and sought to represent those who couldn't, or chose not to, write their stories down. Assignments will include both critical and creative work. |#|ENGL183A PO|^|Adv Creative Writing: Fiction|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Advanced Creative Writing.

Poetry in the World will enable students to 1) recognize the deeply communal function of peotry through traditional literary study in the classroom and 2) build connections between our college campuses and the greater Los Angeles area by partnering with community organizations. The semester will culimate with student-led projects devised in collaboration with their chosen organization.|#|ENGL184D CH|^|Chicana/o Short Fiction|^|SCHS|^|05.0203|^|SC|^|A wide compendium of short stories written by Mexican Americans or Chicanos will be analyzed, dating from the 1930s to the present day. Diverse approacheshistoric, thematic, or regionalwill be employed, as well as a focus on subgenres such as adolescent literature or detective fiction. Authors include Daniel Cano, Sandra Cisneros, Jovita
Gonzales, Américo Paredes, Albert A. Rios, Gary Soto, and others. Cross listed as CHST184D CH. Taught in English. Formerly ENGL184D.|#|ENGL188  PO|^|American Literature After 1945|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The decades following World War II are some of the most vital and controversial in American history, and in the history of American literature. In this course, we will read some of the major literary works of this period with reference to various social and historical contexts. How did American authors process the trauma of war in Europe and Vietnam, on the one hand, and respond to the United States' increasing political and economic centrality in a global context, on the other? How did the Cold War and the specter of Communism, and domestic social movements such as the civil rights movement, the New Left, and feminism affect literary history (and vice versa)? How did the formal techniques of modernism give way to postmodernism, and what role did the growth of universities and the rise of creative writing programs play in this process? Readings will encompass fiction, poetry, and nonfiction. Authors may include Ralph Ellison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Flannery O'Connor, Jorge Luis Borges, Allen Ginsberg, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov, Carlos Fuentes, Elizabeth Bishop, Thomas Pynchon, John Ashbery, Joan Didion, Ishmael Reed, and Toni Morrison.|#|ENGL189B PO|^|Introduction to Literary Theory|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|What is literature? How does it differ from other forms of human communication, representation, and knowledge? How can we assess the meaning, value, and historical significance of individual literary works, and understand the functions and effects of specific genres, tropes, and tendencies? What is an author, and how much power do they have to shape our reading? How, and under what conditions, does literature reflect or intersect with history, politics, sexuality, race, and other social phenomena? These are some of the questions that literary theorists, critics, and philosophers have asked in the 20th and 21st centuries. This course provides a broad overview of some of the major theoretical developments of the past hundred years and serves as an introduction to significant interventions and texts in the literary-critical tradition. Authors may include Viktor Shklovsky, Theodor Adorno, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Hortense Spillers, Judith Butler, Paul Gilroy, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Lauren Berlant. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL189E PO|^|The Nonfiction Novel|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Fictionality is built into the very definition of the novel form. In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a 'nonfiction novel' in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of 'autofiction')? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel's tradition, given the form's historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact? Assigned authors may include Madeleine de Scudéry, Daniel Defoe, Marcel Proust, Ka-tzetnik 135633, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Michael Herr, Ryszard Kapuciñski, Danilo Kis, W.G. Sebald, Janet Malcolm, Ben Lerner, Rachel Cusk, Sheila Heti, Elif Batuman, and Teju Cole.|#|ENGL189H PO|^|Abraham and Paul|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Abraham and Paul. Considers the religious, philosophical and political paradigms established by the Judeo-Christian figures of Abraham and Paul and the ways these paradigms have been contemplated and developed through modern times. Topics include: immigration, conversion, universalism and the exception. Readings from Genesis, Pauls epistles, Medieval mystery plays, Luther, Shakespeare, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Pasolini, Badiou; film by Kieslowski.|#|ENGL190  PO|^|Senior Exercise/Seminar Option|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Senior Exercise/Seminar Option.

In this fiction workshop, students will explore the ways short stories experiment with  time  and  form.  The  first half  of  the  course  will  look  closely  at  how  and  why  short  stories  use flashback,  compression,  and  other  techniques  to  move  non-linearly  through  time.  Students  will  try  outthese  techniques  in  their  own writing ?first  through  short  exercises,  then  in  a  non-linear  short  story, which they'll workshop with the class and revise. The second half of the semester will explore additional ways contemporary short stories experiment with form, including using lists, fairy and folk tales, quizzes, and other ?found? forms. And for their second short story, students  will try out an experimental form of their own invention. Formerly ENGL194S SC. Course does not satisfy Letters general education requirement. |#|ENGL194S SC|^|Adv Fiction Writing Workshop|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This advanced fiction workshop is intended for students who have taken at least one course in fiction writing (ENGL193 or an equivalent course at the Claremont Colleges).

They will also engage with a variety of storytelling genres, including not only fiction and memoir but also film, photography, and song, and though this process of creative discovery, they will hone their intuition for narrative craft and explore what animates them as writers. Over the semester students will draft and revise a portfolio of short stories or a single longer work of narrative prose.

Throughout the course, we?ll focus on how metaphors come alive on the page ? sometimes very literally, in works of magical realism and speculative fiction, and at other times through the ways that images and motifs shift our perceptions of the everyday. As we do so, you?ll apply what we study to your own writing ? first through short exercises that ask you to try out a variety of figurative and speculative techniques, then in two short stories, which you?ll workshop with the class and revise.

May be repeated for credit. Offered one semester per year. Fall 2022: In this course we will explore a hybrid form of documentary poetics by writing our way into and around some of the most intriguing and mysterious texts on record, The Nag Hammadi Library, a 4th century collection of mystical writings housed at the Claremont Graduate University.  We will approach The Gospel of Thomas, The Thunder Perfect Mind, and lesser-known portions of this startling anthology not as scholars or historians, but as detectives, diviners, and poets, imaginatively making sense of what we find, and using what we find to make new forms of sense.  Course is also offered as WRIT197 SC. |#|ENGL198  SC|^|Independent Internship|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|198.  Independent Internship.

These discussions will not only enhance understanding of fashion trends but also improve French language skills in a unique and engaging context. Our exploration extends beyond the glamorous runways of Paris. We delve into the socio-cultural fabric of French society, examining how fashion intersects with politics, history, art, and literature. Canonical French literature, poignant poetry, and timeless paintings will serve as lenses through which we view the evolution of French fashion. These texts and artworks provide rich insights into the societal norms, aesthetic preferences, and historical events that have influenced fashion trends over the centuries. As students traverse the timeline of French fashion, they will also consider its global impact and the dialogue between the metropole and other cultures. This course is not just about fashion; it's an exploration of cultural identity, artistic expression, and societal change, all woven together through the thread of French elegance.|#|FREN105  PO|^|French Phonetics|^|PRLL|^|16.0901|^|PO|^|This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of French Phonetics and pronunciation, based on the use of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the method Verbo-tonale (MVT), focusing on the concept of Oralit (sounds, body gestures), and how it relates to speech production and communication.

What do buildings such as the Eiffel Tower, the Montparnasse tower, Versailles, the Louvre or Notre-Dame can teach us about Paris, France and the French identity? What does looking at HLM (habitation à loyer modéré) and the movies that celebrated them in the 1970's tells us about French politics, French economics and French immigration? To answer such questions, we will read and analyse historical texts, look at the literature (novels, opera, poems etc.) that deal with architecture, and discuss paintings, maps and photography. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: FREN 044  PO.|#|FREN109  PO|^|Intro to French Linguistics|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Examines the phonological, morphological and syntactic aspects of modern French to understand how it functions as a linguistic system.

Prerequisites: FREN044  PO. |#|FREN110  SC|^|Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite?|^|SFR|^||^|SC|^|As elsewhere in the world, neoliberal globalization in France has created winners and losers, resulting in the exacerbation of economic, social, and racial inequalities. The backlash against globalization has taken many forms, from the rise of nationalist populism and its anti-immigrant, anti-European Union sentiments on the far-right, to protest movements such as Nuit-Debout on the far-left. To understand these developments, we will explore: recent industrial dislocations; immigration in the postwar period; the legacy of French colonialism; Islam in France; the "banlieues" as a site of contestation; the recent refugee crisis; Charlie-Hebdo and other recent terrorist attacks and their aftermaths. Taught in French. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent.|#|FREN112  PO|^|Queer Coming of Age|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|This course focuses on the literary and cultural representations of queer characters in Francophone coming-of-age stories. Beyond the individual aspect of the identity quest typical of this popular genre, students will examine how the self-exploration of gender nonconforming and queer characters further challenges traditional family structures and social belongings. By analyzing narratives from France, Morocco, Quebec, Senegal, and Vietnam, students will have the opportunity to reflect on the intersections of sexuality with ethnicity, race, religion, and social class, on both local and global levels.|#|FREN113  SC|^|Banned in France|^|SFR|^|05.0124|^|SC|^|This course considers key ideas and cultural debates of the French Enlightenment by pivoting between the eighteenth century and the present day. Three questions guide our readings and discussions: "Can religion be laughed at?" "How and why is sex and sexual violence discussed in public?" "Can theater change, or merely reflect ideas?" Our purpose is not to find definitive answers, but to understand and critically assess how texts grapple with these questions in the eighteenth century and today. Readings will include Diderot, Gouges, Rousseau, Voltaire, and a range of current texts, from press articles to scholarly essays.|#|FREN115  CM|^|The Francophone Caribbean|^|MMOD|^||^|CM|^|A study of works of writers and artists from Haiti, Guadeloupe, and Martinique.

This course explores Quebec's cultural identity and its relationship to French culture through novels, films, humorists, singers, poets and cultural guides. This class investigates the relationship of France and Quebec via a multi-faceted analysis and uncovers what, in their respective system of values, makes both societies remarkably and perhaps intolerably French. Taught in French. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent.
|#|FREN121  SC|^|The Politics of Love|^|SFR|^||^|SC|^|Through a survey of classic works of French literature and cinema, we will examine how the social functions and economic imperatives of the institution of marriage evolved from the Middle-Ages to the present.  The course will underscore the different ways in which these great French love stories reflect upon, and at times overtly critique, the policing of human desire and love according to patriarchal and exclusionary norms. Literary texts include Tristan & Yseut, Don Juan, Manon Lescaut, Madame Bovary, and L'Amant; theorists include  De Beauvoir, Foucault, Irigaray, Barthes, Bourdieu.  Films include  Le Retour de Martin Guerre, Les Liaisons dangereuses,  Les Enfants du Paradis, Ma Vie en rose, and La Captive. Satisfies the pre-1900 requirement. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent.|#|FREN124  SC|^|Women of Freedom and Desire|^|SFR|^|05.0124|^|SC|^|This course examines the journeys of desire at the heart of four profoundly diverse French texts dating from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. From Mme de Lafayette's courtly Versailles novel to the Balzacian salon; and through the eyes of Colette's "Gig" and the passions of Marguerite Duras' "Lover," we will examine the protagonists' quests for freedom from shiny rings, golden cages, and strict expectations. Underpinning the construction of feminine identity central to each of the texts will be a charting fo the evolution of French fiction.|#|FREN125  SC|^|The French Detective|^|SLAN|^||^|SC|^|The French Detective and Classic Crime Fiction:
French mystery novels are steeped in crime, grime, and wine. And they abound in evocative detective figures. Some of these sleuths, such as Vidocq (1809), are felons turned policemen while others, such as Arsï¿½ne Lupin (1905), are themselves masters of the caper. Maigret from the 1930s emerged as the compassionate lawman of the people, Nestor Burma from the 1950s as the ultimate hard-boiled private detective whereas Commissaire Adamsberg, from the 1990s, is the puzzle-solving dreamer. Through a selection of short stories, novel and graphic novels, TV and film, we will examine how French mystery novels explore and construct Gallic wit, personality, and social mores from the 1800s to today. Prerequisite: French 44 or equivalent required. Course is taught in French.|#|FREN127  SC|^|French Contemp Women Directors|^|SFR|^|05.0124|^|SC|^|The first film director in the history of narrative cinema was a French woman, Alice Guy-BlachÃ©, who, starting in 1896, made over a 1000 films during her lifetime. Even though early precursors like Guy-BlachÃ©, were often erased from film history, women directors in France have a long tradition to draw from. It is this tradition of women filmmaking that we will explore in this course, focusing in particular on a new generation of women directors who today are revitalizing contemporary French cinema. Directors studied include: Guy, Dulac, Epstein, Varda, Akerman, Denis, Palcy, Sciamma, MaÃ¯wenn, Benguigui, Braillat, Ducournau. This course introduces students to the art of cinema, its language and techniques, as well as to film analysis. Taught in French with weekly screenings. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent required.

Note that the course will be conducted entirely in French and that some of the films will be screened without subtitles.|#|FREN129  PO|^|Who's Afraid of Marcel Proust?|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Who's afraid of Marcel Proust?  What does Marcel Proust's monumental project teach us about French literature? How did his pastiches and references to the literary canon help Proust write? This course connects close readings of passages from "La Recherche" and their direct and indirect sources (Marie de France, Ronsard, Racine, Chateaubriand, Nerval, Sand, Bergson, etc.) as a way to review the spectrum of French literature. Prerequisites: 101. Letter grade only. |#|FREN133  CM|^|Africa in France|^|MMOD|^||^|CM|^|Since the late 1960s, new generations of French citizens has emerged to redefine France and Frenchness. These new generations are French citizens whose parents or grandparents were originally from North Africa or sub-Saharan Africa, yet who grew up or were born in France, often in the suburbs of major French cities. This course will focus on their experience and more broadly the experience of being African in France in the 21st Century, an experience rooted in migration and colonial history between France and the African continent. Specifically, however, we will also examine the place this new generation occupies in France today through close readings of selected literary and critical texts and through a range of media, old and new, aural and visual.|#|FREN142  SC|^|Comedy in the Age of Louis XIV|^|SLAN|^||^|SC|^|This course takes a dual approach to examining the politics of laughter during the reign of Louis XIV. In the first half of the course, our readings of work by Isaac de Benserade, Moliere, Francoise Pascal will focus on the various funtions of laughter and comedy, particularly with respect to issues of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. In the second half of the course, students will work in teams to create and perform a micro-scene based on one of the plays. |#|FREN150A PO|^|Les Moralistes - Pub/Priv Selves|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Les Moralistes: Public and Private Selves.

Prerequisite: 101. |#|FREN152  PO|^|Literature as Resistance|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|How do literary works challenge so-called natural hierarchies such as class, race, and gender? Do they also reinforce them? Our corpus focuses on masters, servants and slaves in order to ask who is, and should be, on top. Famous plays by Moliere and Beaumarchais expose the absurdity of traditional class and gender relations.

|#|GOVT174C CM|^|Politcs, Phil, & War: Xenophon|^|MGVT|^||^|CM|^|Xenophon, like Plato, was a student of Socrates. But Xenophon led a more active life, traveling to Persia where he became general of an army of Greek mercenaries. This practical bend is reflected in the Anabasis, describing his adventures in Persia, and the Education of Cyrus, an account of how to conquer the world that earned Machiavelli's approval. Yet Xenophon also wrote the Memorabilia, a work devoted to a consideration of Socrates and his more contemplative way of life. This class will consist of a close reading of these works with particular attention to the tension between the political and philosophic life.
|#|GOVT177C CM|^|James Baldwin|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|James Baldwin was one of the most important writers of the 20th century. He engaged questions of political philosophy and practice through his essays, fiction, oratory, and activism. In this course we will reflect on Baldwin's answers to fundamental questions about freedom, love, power, democracy, and justice in three major ways. First, we will think about "autobiography as political philosophy" by way of Baldwin's autobiographical essays and his autobiographical novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain. Second, we will examine Baldwin's reflections on identity, love, freedom, and power by way of his second novel novel, Giovanni's Room, and two of his major essay collections: Nobody Knows My Name and The Fire Next Time. In the final part of the class, we will engage Baldwin's ideas by way of conversations he had with other artists, intellectuals, and activists, including conservatives such as William F. Buckley Jr., fellow activists such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and feminist thinkers such as Nikki Giovanni and Audre Lorde.
|#|GOVT179  CM|^|Law, Order, Justice, and Society|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This course considers the ideas of major writers in the field of political theory who have contributed insight into the concepts of law, order, justice, and society.

Racial capitalism as a framework recognizes that capitalism is inherently social and that capitalist value production has thrived on the violent and violative production of social and spatial difference and separability. We will learn from interdisciplinary scholars that have asked and investigated how and where categories of difference like race, class, gender, and sexuality are in productive tension with the relations of property, ownership, and capitalist value. We will learn about abolition democracy as a political intellectual model that precedes and exceeds the developmental model of racial capitalism by grounding abolition democracy within Black and Indigenous studies and Gender and Sexuality studies. Abolition democracy is not just a response to racial capitalism and racist violence, but is a way of being and knowing that offers insights to some of our most pressing social concerns.|#|GWS 140  PO|^|Queer Of Color Lit And Theory|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This class will examine the central texts of queer of color (Black, Latinx, Asian American and others) theory, while also studying the novels, poetry and plays of important authors.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?|#|GWS 166  PO|^|Witchcraft|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|From the Witch of Endor to Harry Potter, the witch has become a lodestone for debates surrounding fantasy, gender, race, religion, and sexuality. This course explores the history of witchcraft in cross-cultural and cross-historical perspective. Under what circumstances did concern about witches arise and gain traction? In what ways were accusations of witchcraft gendered and raced? How have people today sought to rehabilitate witches, or deploy them for their own purposes? This course argues that the witch is a revelatory figure. If we pay close attention to her, we can see vast terrains of human interaction that might otherwise go unnoticed in historical analysis.|#|GWS 170  PO|^|Disability Studies|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This course provides an overview of the growing field of disability studies. The first part of the course will focus on the field's foundations, analyzing the investments in the notion of disability from a variety of fields, approaches and definitions, such as the law, medicine and the arts. In particular, the intersectional dimensions of disability will be stressed, as the category has played a key role in the production and organization of gender, race, sexuality, class and religion. The second part of the course will give an introduction to some of the major directions and shifts within the field, such as the transgendered body & medicalization, invisible disabilities, transnationalism, animal studies, new materialisms and technology/media. Prerequisites: GWS 026 PO or FGSS 036 SC.|#|GWS 172  PO|^|Race, Gender, & The Environment|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This course takes an intersectional approach to environmental studies, emphasizing critical feminist, queer, trans, race, and disability studies. Highlighting decolonial and indigenous thought in particular, course assignments examine planetary futures that reflect on how histories of imperial conquest, settler colonialism, and global capitalism have contributed to anthropogenic climate change. Another goal of the class is to question how contemporary approaches to environmentalism might have arisen out of already limited epistemological frameworks and legal histories. As part of our investigation into the asymmetrical distribution of toxins and environmental fallout across different populations, students will not only grapple with biopolitical theory but also look to a range of cultural texts - from science fiction films to contemporary fiction to graphic art - to consider alternative political assemblages and strategies for survival that arise from gender and ethnic studies frameworks. Prerequisites: GWS 026  PO. |#|GWS 180  PO|^|Queer Feminist Theories|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This class provides an overview of recent critical work in the field of feminist and queer theory. It is a necessary course for both the GWS major and minor. Emphasis on intersections with critical race and transnational theory; materials will be drawn from a broad range of disciplines including anthropology, history, political philosophy, literature and others. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: GWS 026  PO.  May be repeated twice for credit.|#|GWS 182  PO|^|Feminist and Queer Materialism|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This course will take up recent developments in political and cultural theory that engage the changing planetary and political landscape via an inquiry into the materiality of the world. We will read recent work in affect theory, object-oriented ontology and inquire into the conversation between old materialism (Marxism and class analysis) and new materialism (an interest that the physical life of the world has vital consequences for its human and animal inhabitants). Prerequisites: One other course in queer, feminist or media theory. Letter grade only.|#|GWS 183  PO|^|Transnational Feminist Theories|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|Globalization has been defined as the increasing interconnectedness among nations and peoples in all fields around the globe. The process has had multiple cultural, economic, and political effects on conceptualizations of "sexuality" and its relationship to gender across the world. In this class, we will learn how to situate cultural, and historical understandings of gender and sexuality in their geopolitical contexts. We will examine concepts of identity, sexual practices, and queerness in relation to notions of the local-global, nationhood, the transnational, diaspora, borders, margins, and urban-rural. We will bring postcolonial, decolonial, transnational, queer, and feminist disciplinary approaches to talk to each other, in order to study how knowledge about sex, gender and sexuality is produced and disseminated transnationally. Prerequisite: GWS 026  PO.  |#|GWS 184  PO|^|Trans/Gender-Variant Aesthetics|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This course surveys foundational and recent scholarship in trans studies and places these critical materials in dialogue with cultural productions (like literature, film/media, and visual and performance art) by gender-nonconforming artists, writers, media-makers, and performers. In this class, "trans" will act as an umbrella (if a potentially insufficient one) for multiple modalities of gender-nonnormativity, including transgender, nonbinary, intersex, and Two-Spirit identities. We will discuss how gender-variance enables contestations of colonial-imperial and racializing ideologies of gender. To these ends, we will center the intersectional dimensions of gender-variance by examining its interlocking and co-constitutive relations with race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, disability, mobility, and citizenship. Given trans studies' critiques of academic disciplinarity and nation-based analytical frameworks, this course will embrace transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transnational approaches. |#|GWS 186  PO|^|Theories of the Body|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|The body has been theorized, understood and controlled in a variety of ways by artists, theorists, politicians, governments and churches, amongst many others. This course will examine the multiple modes by which the body has been understood and imagined, drawing primarily from queer, feminist, disability and critical race scholars.  In addition, we will explore the political implications of how the body is theorized. Rather than perpetuating a universalist understanding of the body as ahistorical or demanding an over-determined particularity around the body that neglects forms of relationality, we will seek to balance questions of bodily matter and experience with gestures towards relations to another. We will read scholars such as Hortense Spillers, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault, Susan Stryker, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jean-Luc Nancy, Mel Chen, Bryan Turner and Gilles Deleuze. Prerequisites: GWS 026  PO or FGSS036  SC and one upper-division course in GWS. |#|GWS 189B PO|^|LGBTQ Social Movements in the US|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This interdisciplinary course will examine the development of LGBTQ social movements in the US by linking the context, goals, and outcomes of movements to the dynamics of race, class, gender, sexuality, age, ability, immigration status, and geography. Our goal will be to understand the ways that LGBTQ social movements impact and are impacted by cultural and governmental institutions, and how these relationships have determined contemporary queer life, politics and thought. We will also examine several ongoing issues that have inspired LGBTQ organizing. We will incorporate non-academic critical sources, video clips, films, guest speakers, community events into our learning environment in order to explore the multiple facets of LGBTQ political work.

In this course we will explore how common narratives of heroism and of the well-lived life shaped the political and cultural histories of the Mediterranean world from 3000 B.C.E. to 400 C.E., from the rise of the earliest Ancient Near Eastern empires through the decline of the Roman Empire. There will be a strong emphasis on engaging with the ancient sources in translation, with readings drawn especially from the genres of epic (Homer's Iliad, Epic of Gilgamesh, Hesiod's Works & Days), historiography (Herodotus, Thucydides, Sallust, Livy, Tacitus), and biography (Law Code of Hammurabi, Xenophon's Agesilaus, Plutarch's Lives, and the Passion of Perpetua).|#|HIST010  PO|^|The Ancient Mediterranean|^|PHST|^||^|PO|^|This course surveys the political and cultural histories of the Mediterranean world from 3000 B.C.E. to 400 C.E., from the rise of the earliest Ancient Near Eastern empires through the decline of the Roman Empire.

The great division of intellectual labor that these human sciences represent can
seem so natural and so logical, that it is sometimes hard to imagine a world without
them. But these disciplines did not always exist. In exploring their histories, we
simultaneously ask about the contingency of our world and about how it might be

This introduction to the origin of the modern world focuses on the cultural transferences and translations between Europe and the rest of the world between roughly 1400 and 1815 and the cultural, intellectual, political, religious, and social transformations that shaped these encounters. Historians claim that the distinguishing feature of the modern world is the intensification of globalization, and so we will concentrate on how early modern people experienced transnational and transcultural exchange, attending to systems of power and inequality. Moreover, we will examine how emergent attitudes towards race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality intersected to shape the lives of the figures we study in a period of profound metamorphosis and dynamic engagement between Europe and the rest of the early modern world.|#|HIST070A SC|^|United States History to 1865|^|SHIS|^|54.0101|^|SC|^|A survey of the major social, economic, intellectual, and political developments from the period of colonial settlement to the Civil War.

The course scrutinizes the uneasy relationship between international institutions, laws and human rights advocates and local Latin American crimes against humanity and indigenous struggles for justice. The first section of the class focuses on the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Amazon during the rubber boom (1901-1912), emphasizing the role that international pressure played in ending the mass violence. Then, it delves into changes made to international human rights with the establishment of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

Beginning with the notion that ecological life on Earth is entangled and 'dark,' not pristine and 'green' nature, the course examines the mesh that interconnects environment and society in the Anthropocene.  Topics range from the impact of modern science and transformations on global environments, ecological thought and perceptions, climate change, biological exchanges, and the ruins and landscapes left in their aftermaths. Readings include works by Timothy Moreton, Anna Tsing, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Amitav Ghosh, Anne Stoler, Timothy Mitchell, and a film noir series.

How did European colonial expansion aid the development of scientific knowledge and vice versa? What roles did colonial places and peoples play in the development of European science? We examine the history of natural history, medicine, and geography and the evolution of such concepts as nature, race, and climate. We also gain practice in conceptualizing, researching, writing, and revising a substantial research essay based on primary historical sources.|#|HIST101F PO|^|Food & Environment in Asia/Pacif|^|PHST|^||^|PO|^|A single question inspired this seminar: what explains the relationship of food and the environment in Asia and the Pacific over the last century (1915-2015)? Over the course of the semester, we will examine four different answers to that question. We will ask how has the definition of specific Asian cuisines shaped their relationship to the environment? Then we will turn to the creators of cuisineschefsand ask how have their culinary decisions affected the environment? The third section will consider the way restaurants market themselves and ask what do their representations reveal about their relationships with the environment. And the last section will focus on the important farm-to-table movement and ask how, if at all, has it changed prevailing views of food and the environment? Letter grade only.

We explore the themes of gender bending, sex work, plastic surgeries, disabilities, illness and death and investigate the multiple ways in which East Asian societies construct and communicate the desirable and healthy body. By looking at historical and cross-cultural examples, students will be confronted with the realities of sexual and body diversity and discrimination. We will also explore the socio-cultural mechanisms that shape our individual and collective notions of identity. The course will address issues through various forms of texts, visual images, memoirs, documentaries, letters and other writings, as well as secondary scholarly and journalistic works.

Colombia, with a focus on the African Diaspora. Starting in 1791, the enslaved broke their chains in the Haitian Revolution and radically recast the promise of freedom in the Americas. Colombia is home to the second largest Black population in Latin America after Brazil, and Blacks have stood at the heart of its struggles for dignity across the course of the nations history.

Throughout the colonial era (1697 to 1791 in Haiti and the 1520s to 1810 in Colombia), the poor practiced marronage or escape from beneath the control of European slave elites and metropoles. Metaphorically, those who liberate themselves or break free are the maroon nations, the peoples who have built societies based upon egalitarianism and profound respect for the land. Ranged against them were elites closely tied to Europeans, at first, and then to the United States, up to the present.

Black Colombians have won rights to the land that are historic for all people in the African Diaspora in the hemisphere.

This course examines themes of race, nationality, and citizenship in Black American political thought in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Taught as a reading/discussion seminar, the class introduces students to major movements and debates that contour what is referred to as Black Internationalism. How have Black activists contended with U.S. foreign policy and forged solidarity with liberation movements around the world? How have U.S. understandings of race been shaped by global constructions of race, class, and caste?

|#|HIST176  CM|^|Early American Families|^|MHIS|^|54.0101|^|CM|^|This course examines the meaning and construction of family units in the Atlantic World from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Economic changes, imperial migrations, interracial sex, and transatlantic ideas molded and shaped the notion of what a family was. Similar concepts, such as marriage, illegitimacy, and households shifted in turn. In this seminar, we will explore these changes in different imperial systems during the era of European Atlantic colonization.

|#|HIST181  PZ|^|Explorations in Deep Time|^|ZHIS|^||^|PZ|^|At the end of the seventeenth century, the bottom dropped out of time. Those accustomed to thinking of the Earth and of humanity, according to biblical timescales now had to confront the possibility of "deep time", the possibility of a time whose magnitude defied the imagination. We will examine that shift and its consequences, as it played itself out through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with ramification into the present. |#|HIST184  PO|^|Global Environmental Histories|^|PHST|^||^|PO|^|This seminar explores different approaches to environmental history, from classic works by Alfred Crosby and James Scott to more recent scholarship, focusing on diverse ways of telling stories about people and nature.

By engaging with the growing field of "climate history," we approach climate in three ways: as physical reality, scientific idea, and cultural perception. We examine interactions between climatic and political and social change; colonial histories of acclimatization, geoengineering, and climatology; connections between climate and ideas about race; the discovery of global warming; and the concept of the Anthropocene. By investigating historical relationships between climate and society, we uncover how the past can inform our understanding of climate change in the present and future.|#|HIST188  CM|^|Islamic World: Travel/Encounter|^|MHIS|^|54.0101|^|CM|^|How does travel shape self-definitions and regional stereotypes? What can studying the history of travel and tourism tell us about the shift from early modern empires to colonial worlds and to the contemporary processes of globalization? This class is designed to help you explore and formulate answers to these questions by looking at how the region, which we commonly refer to as the "Middle East" and the "Islamic World," came to be constructed historically through circuits of travel and cross-cultural encounters. We will investigate tensions inherent in the history of travel itself: between travel as pleasure, leisure, and a means for spiritual fulfillment vs. travel as a mode of conquest, a strategy for economic and political survival and an experience of alienation. Our over-arching goal will be to analyze how travel functions simultaneously as a means of identification with another culture and as a re-affirmation of cultural difference.  Previously HIST159I

|#|HMSC133  SC|^|Modernity and the Unconscious|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Beyond the theme of sexuality, Freud's discovery of repression and the unconscious has been enormously influential in challenging the foundations of modern experience. This course brings Freud's central analytic concepts into conversation with those of the twentieth-century philosopher Jacques Derrida in order to explore how the vision of a mind characterized by the unconscious has profoundly shaped aspects of modern experience. Topics to be addressed: scientific thought, love, death, identity.

|#|HMSC138  SC|^|Genet|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Among an impressive group of post-World War II European writers, Jean Genet stands out as perhaps the most versatile.  He was, at once, novelist, playwright, philosopher, filmmaker, memoirist, and polemicist. Is this the reason why Genet's works, though lauded by both Sartre and Derrida, today occupy a "minor" position in both the academy and the literate world beyond? Through a close reading of some of his most important texts, this course will consider how Genet deployed and confronted sexuality, family, morality, and nation as interrelated aspects of the operations of inclusion/exclusion so central to modern Western societies. This course is designed for mature audiences. |#|HMSC139  SC|^|The Essay Film, Hist & Theory|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|The essay film is a slippery form. It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and oneâs place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the âessayisticâ and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the âessayâ does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno.

An interdisciplinary approach to the works of Castiglione, Della Casa, Machiavelli, Aretino, Straparola, Ariosto, and Gaspara Stampa (among the others) will provide further analysis and understanding of the cultural context of the Italian Renaissance, an era that witnessed the birth of the Italian fairy tale tradition, the unique contributions that women made to the early modern Italian society, and a mushrooming of pivotal political ideas and topics such as the relationship between ethics and politics, and the theoretic foundations of the buon governo. Particular emphasis will be given to the interrelationships between literature and other aspects of life in Renaissance Italy, such as politics, religion, social trends, and culture. 
Prerequisite: ITAL044 SC. |#|ITAL133  SC|^|Contemporary Italy|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|This course explores recent trends in Italian literature, film and the arts. Organized around a different theme each time it is offered, it explores the current debates in literature, cinema, art, and popular culture, and their relation to Italian history and current events. Repeatable three times for credit with different topics. |#|ITAL134  SC|^|20C Italian Women's Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|Works by some of the most well known authors of the 20th century. What do these authors have to say about issues of social justice, and especially gender? How were these works received by various audiences? Who decides what books qualify as "great art," and how? Authors to be read include: Sibilla Aleramo, Grazia Deledda, Natalia Ginzburg, Elsa Morante, and Dacia Maraini. Prerequisite: Italian 44 or equivalent. 
|#|ITAL137  SC|^|Italy as a Murder Mystery|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|In this course, we will explore in detail all the characteristics of the "giallo" genre and subgenres related to it (such as horror stories and legal narratives), its widespread reception and its inherent multiple textuality, which includes novels, film and comic books. Such texts will open the way to the cultural analysis of the representation of real "gialli," or violent episodes in Italian history that have been on the spotlight for different reasons and in different ways of investigation and have contributed to the formation of Italian modernity.


|#|ITAL140  SC|^|Italian Cinema|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course will explore the history and criticism of Italian cinema from its origin to the 21st century through the showing of a number of iconic films and the criticism surrounding them. It will also help student better understand contemporary Italian history through film. Taught alternately in Italian and English.
|#|ITAL141  SC|^|Italian History Through Film|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|This course will examine the important events that marked Italian history (1861-present) through the analysis of films produced during and/or about those times. We will not concentrate on film history, but rather on how cinema has portrayed history over the years. For this reason, the course will not explore well known materpieces of Italian cinema, but we will instead analyze the impact of less known productions, films made for television or films that were not destined to foreign distribution, in order to analyze how Italian history has been translated in to the popular imaginary. The course will be taught entirely in Italian.|#|ITAL142  SC|^|Italian Cinema & Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course offers an introduction to Boccaccio's Decameron, one of the masterpieces of Italian literature, through a close reading of Boccaccio's collection of hundred tales, an investigation of the literary traditions (tradizioni) that converge in the most important prose work of the Italian Middle Ages, and its cinematic "translations" (traduzioni/tradimenti). During the semester, we will read all the novellas that have been adapted for the screen by Pier Paolo Pasolini (Decameron, 1971), and the Taviani brothers (Magnifico Boccaccio, 2015) identifying the challenges that such a classical Italian work presents to Italian filmmakers in their attempts to transcribe it into an audiovisual spectacle. By reading and analyzing a large selection of Boccaccio's one hundred novelle, and watching and examining their corresponding filmic transpositions, we will address notions and problems of language, style, structure and content for each novella, together with the techniques of transposition of the written text to the movie screen. Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent.|#|ITAL143  SC|^|Contemporary Italian Music & Lit|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|143. Contemporary Italian Music and Literature.
This course will explore the development of twentieth century Italian music and literature, and the ways these two art forms have interacted with one another. Students will analyze poetry and music in the context of the styles, schools, techniques, and artistic objectives that characterize and inform them. Prerequisite: Italian 44. R. Andreoni.
|#|ITAL145  SC|^|Italian Literature of Gastronomy|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|The year 2020 marks the two hundredth anniversary of Pellegrino Artusi's birth, author of La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (1891), the most prominent and famous Italian cookbook in the history of gastronomy. However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen.  Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining "Italianess", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.	
Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent.|#|ITAL146  SC|^|Losers in Italian Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course scrutinizes and reconsiders the concept of losing and its implications by analyzing fictional characters from the Italian short story tradition (from its origins to the twentieth century) who have been addressed as "perdenti, reietti, inetti vinti, sconfitti, and falliti" but who, in the end, have made history in literature by showing how getting lost, losing, and being defeated should carry no shame because, as Umberto Eco claimed, "losers are much more interesting than winners, since they invite the readers to find the reasons for their failure."

In Fall 2024, this course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can request students meet with them to explain their motivation prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing, and the need to submit personal information for background checks.|#|LGCS010  PO|^|Introduction to Linguistics|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|What exactly is language?

Students will study the differences between pidgins and creoles, the various theories for how these languages emerge from their source languages, and how the genesis of contact languages differentiates them from languages with supposedly more gradual development. We will analyze the idea of "simplicity" as a loaded linguistic and cultural term. While the class will primarily focus on the languages that developed out of contact between Europeans and Africans during the slave trade, we will consider languages emerging from additional sociohistorical contexts as well.|#|LGCS114  PO|^|Linguistic Discrimination|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|This course is an introduction to the ways in which language can be used as a tool of empowerment or disempowerment for individuals and groups.

Course is equivalent to LGCS 130 PO, PSYC 141 PO, NEUR 101 PO, NEUR 143 PO, PSYC 123 SC, PSYC 101 PZ, PSYC 111 PZ, and PSYC 096 CM.|#|LGCS135  PO|^|Bilingual Cognition|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|An introduction to the relationship between bilingualism and cognition, using evidence from cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, and psycholinguistics. This course will explore the cognitive and neurobiological underpinnings of being bilingual and acquiring a second language, with a particular emphasis on how bilingual experience impacts language processing, cognitive control, and cognitive aging. Prerequisites: LGCS011  PO. Letter grade only.|#|LGCS166  PZ|^|Topics in Sociolinguistics|^|ZLIN|^||^|PZ|^|Topics in Sociolinguistics: Language, Gender, and Ethnicity in Disney

This course will explore how social identities are represented through language
variation in the Disney and Pixar films. We will look at the type of language that is
associated with masculinity or femininity in these films, as well as how queerness is
represented. Also, we will explore representations of different ethnic groups across
Disney films and other media. How is language used to present (often harmful) ideas
about different ethnic groups? Has any progress been made in these representations
over time? Students will conduct a sociolinguistic research project on language and
ideologies about gender and/or ethnicity in childrenâs media.|#|LGCS183  PO|^|Topics in Generative Syntax|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|Examines recent developments in generative syntactic theory within the framework of the Minimalist Program.

Previously offered as LGCS185C PO.|#|LGCS186  PO|^|Investigating Child Language|^|PLCS|^||^|PO|^|This course is a research seminar investigating a particular theory of children's acquisition of syntactic structures. The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasello's Construction Grammar (a theory of the child acquisition of syntax), and an introduction to Chomsky's Minimalist Program (a theory of adult language syntax). The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they don't have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora. Letter grade only.

We'll read contemporary short stories, poems, and personal essays, looking at the choices writers have made in terms of structure, technique, and content.  We'll then put this knowledge to use by trying our hands at fiction, creative non-fiction, and formal and free verse.  By the end of the course, students will have had the chance to experience literature from the writer's side-and perhaps will have found a genre to explore in more depth in further creative writing classes. 
|#|LIT 034  CM|^|Creative Journalism|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|An intensive hands-on course in feature writing styles and journalistic ethics; a primer for writing in today's urban America. Essentially, journalism, like all art, tells a story. How that story is told is as critical to the success of a piece as the importance of its theme. A series of writing exercises and reporting "assignments" will give both inexperienced and more advanced writers the tools to explore their writerly "voice." Special attention will be devoted to discussions of the role of the journalist in society. All registered students must attend the first class.|#|LIT 035  HM|^|Fiction Writing Workshop|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course is designed as an introductory workshop focusing on the writing of fiction and the discourse of craft. Through the examination of a variety of literary traditions, stylistic and compositional approaches, and the careful reading and editing of peer stories, students will strengthen their prose and develop a clearer understanding of their own literary values and the dynamics of fiction.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 037  CM|^|Poetry Writing I|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This class is an introductory workshop in poetry writing for those who wish to improve their craft as poets while broadening their knowledge of poetry. More than half the semester will be devoted to formal weekly exercises. Poems by students will be discussed in a "workshop" format with attention to the process of revision. Class time will also be spent on assigned readings and issues of craft. Students will be asked to regularly memorize and recite poems. A final portfolio of eight revised poems will be required for completion of the course. Prerequisite: LIT 037 CM or comparable experience.|#|LIT 038  CM|^|Fiction Writing|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course, which will be conducted as a workshop, will deal with both short and long forms of fiction. Participants, who may choose either form, will present their original manuscripts and will discuss those submitted by their fellow writers. |#|LIT 057  CM|^|British Writers I|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|A survey of the major British writers from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Throughout the course we will pay attention to how this literature reflects political, religious, and philosophical influences, as well as particular aspects of the early development of the English language.|#|LIT 060  CM|^|American Writers to 1900|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|A survey of major American writing (excluding novels) illustrating the development of a national literature from the Colonial period through the 19th century. Readings will be chosen from the works of such representative writers as Edwards, Franklin, Hawthorne, Poe, Melville, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Dickinson and Henry James. Considerable attention will also be paid to the social and philosophical forces which influenced the literature. Second semester. |#|LIT 066  CM|^|Shakespeare's Comedies|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|Shakespeare's comedies have entertained audiences for four centuries; they are also complex works of art which reward detailed study. In this course we will read eight of Shakespeare's comedies, from the lighthearted play The Taming of the Shrew to the darker Measure for Measure, and supplement our readings with film. We will discuss topics such as love; sex; marriage; gender roles; parents and children; figurative language; jokes; scansion; performance in Shakespeare's time and ours; the nature of comedy; happy endings and those excluded from them.|#|LIT 090  CM|^|Emily Dickinson|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|Emily Dickinson wrote more than 1,500 short poems, but not a single long poem, nor an essay.   Her poems were unknown by nearly all her contemporaries.  The poems have had immense impact, however, on later poets, and she has reached a very broad readership.  She and Walt Whitman-altogether different from one another--are the most canonical of American poets.  Her poems have come to stand for privacy, intensity, compression, and intellectuality.  She wrote in a meter familiar to all those who have sung hymns in Christian churches.  Her syntax and diction, though, are often peculiar, like that of no other English-language poet.
|#|LIT 093  CM|^|Becoming Elizabeth Bishop|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|American Poet Elizabeth Bishop was a genius impersonating an ordinary woman. She is an essential poet of the twentieth century and a national treasure. This course will introduce students to her magnificent poems, lesser-known prose, artful correspondence, and translations from the Portuguese. While also considering Surrealism, ekphrasis, nationality, power, gender, and sexual orientation (Bishop was lesbian), we will make a close study of poetic language and the aesthetics of formalism vs free verse. Alongside Bishopâs intimate, closely observed poems, we will also read work by Robert Lowell, Marianne Moore, May Swenson, Carlos Drummond de Andrade and Octavio Paz. |#|LIT 097  CM|^|T.S. Eliot and His Circle|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course offers an examination of T.S. Eliot, one of the preeminent poets of the twentieth century. We will consider the entirety of Eliots small output of poems and plays and many of his seminal critical essays, studying his relation to traditions of British, European, and classical poetry and his engagement with philosophical, moral, metaphysical, and religious questions. We will pay special attention to issues of modernism, poetic form, and intertextuality, to the idea of a poetic canon, and to the links between poetry and the other arts (music, painting, sculpture). We will also situate Eliots work in the context of the broader sociocultural crisis of modernity in the first half of the twentieth century, as well as in its contemporary literary context, spending time on other poets whom Eliot admired and was influenced by, such as Pound and Yeats, but also on poets who rebelled against his influence, such as William Carlos Williams.
|#|LIT 099  CM|^|Special Topics in Literature|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|Offered occasionally. The topic for Fall 2024 is "Children's Literature".

This course surveys the range of writing for (and, to some extent, about) children from Antiquity to the present â from Aesop's Fables, through the New England Primer, to classics such as Alice in Wonderland and the Wind in the Willows, through twentieth-century writers, and ending up with Niel Gaman and the Percy Jackson books. It is a course about the forms and contexts of childrenâs books and the ways in which certain key texts, authors, themes, and genres cross times and cultures. It is also a course about the ways of reading and interpreting childrenâs literature. But it must be, too, a course in appreciation: we all have books that defined us as children, that we treasure and remember, and that we reread in the hope of restoring a memory or a self. Attendance, participation, and three papers. |#|LIT 100  CM|^|Literary Theory Since Plato|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|What is a good book? How do we decide whether a work of literature is worth reading? What is the basis of literary judgment? How do we bring history, religion, and myth to bear on our understanding of literary texts? How does imaginative literature differ from other forms of discourse? These are among the fundamental questions explored in this course through the eyes of major literary thinkers. The course examines literary criticism as a discipline with unique traditions of inquiry beginning with classical debates about form and reality and the tensions between the moral and aesthetic dimensions of literature as they have been engaged by such writers as Plato and Aristotle, Sidney, Johnson, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Arnold and Pater, Woolf, and Eliot. |#|LIT 107  HM|^|Fourteen Poems: Intro to Poetry|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|In this course, we study what poetry is and how it is used in the world. Neither strictly canonical nor historical in approach, this course introduces students to a wide range of English-language poems, most of them from the last two centuries. In most weeks throughout the semester, we focus on one or two primary poems (fourteen primary poems in all), with the support of companion poems that provide context. This course is writing intensive.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 118  CM|^|The Romantic Revolution|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|A study of the revolution in human consciousness known as Romanticism. The course concentrates on the British Romantics, but also studies Romanticism as an international phenomenon. Writers studied include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Rousseau, Goethe, Schiller, Emerson, Thoreau, Lermontov.|#|LIT 129  CM|^|African American Literature|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This course introduces students to some of the most influential literary and vernacular texts emerging from the African American cultural context. For the most part, these literary and vernacular works will be considered in relation to the historical moments in which they were produced. This historicized approach will provoke class discussions primarily focused on the way in which black literary production chronicled, reflected, and contributed to African America's varied, vexed relation to the American "democratic project." Attention to history will also lead students into considerations of the intimate connection between the aesthetic choices of African American writers and the evolving legal and social statuses of black people in America.|#|LIT 138  CM|^|Film and Mass Culture|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course will examine film as art and as medium in the context of the rise of 20th-century "mass culture." We will take up such topics as the role of film in producing the ideas of "mass culture"; the cinematic representation of the "masses;" film as an instrument of the standardization of culture and as a mode of resistance to it; film and modernism; film and postmodernism; representations of fascism in cinema; and "subculture" considered as an effect of mass culture.|#|LIT 139  CM|^|Film Theory|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course investigates the major film theories from the beginnings of cinema to the present.  We begin with a study of classical film theory (1900-1960) that attempts to define the essence of the form, its relation to reality, and its status as mass medium and/or art.  We then move on to more recent work that examines film from ideological, sociological, or psychological perspectives, or considers the changing nature of cinema in the digital age.
|#|LIT 148  CM|^|Literature and the Brain|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|Reading and writing literature has always been predicated upon beliefs and assumptions about how literature plays with the human mind. With recent developments in neuroscience and experimental psychology, scholars now have unprecedented access into the human brain, with many questions yet to be answered about how its operations yield âthe mind.â How should emerging research in cognitive and neuroscience inform our understanding of the nature and function of literary texts? In the process, we return to issues that have energized writers and theorists from Utpaladeva and Mammatta to Flaubert and Wordsworth. |#|LIT 154  CM|^|Europe/India:Lit in Conversation|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This course is concerned with the core questions we ask of literature in its many manifestations: Why do we read stories? What do they do to us? How do they reflect and probe the human condition? Focusing especially on Europe and India, this course is concerned with how these general problems get expressed in distinct literary traditions over centuries of humanistic inquiry. In developing a cross-cultural understanding of the same general problems, the course poses a question that has even greater stakes in our globalizing world: how can we make cultures converse with each other? Topics of particular interest will be conceptualizations of the âworldâ itself, the reception of tradition, the status of translation, and the aftermaths of imperialism.|#|LIT 156  HM|^|Translation/Foreignness of Lang|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This seminar is designed to introduce students to the foreignness of language through literary translation theory and its praxis. Participants will develop individual projects that will be revised and workshopped over the course of the semester. Weekly readings, including essays by theoreticians, accomplished writer-translators, and selections of multiple translations of a single text, will be used to familiarize students with a range of perspectives on translation and its relationship to writing. Prerequisite: Students must have reading knowledge of at least one foreign language.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 162  AF|^|African Literature|^|MMOD|^||^|CM|^|Reading and analysis of novels, poetry, and essays representing the most important trends in modern African literature.

|#|LIT 179AJHM|^|Exercises in Fiction|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This writing and reading studio is intended and designed for students with no prior workshop experience. Through a series of exercises, instructive readings, peer feedback sessions, and a formal workshop, students will practice and analyze a variety of storytelling techniques. Writing assignments will encourage play in genre and style. Emphasis will be placed on cultivating a supportive and collaborative writing community. |#|LIT 179AKHM|^|Orientalism|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|In 1978 Edward Said published his groundbreaking study on the relationship between the Orient (east) and the Occident, (west) arguing that the Orient had long served as the location through which the Occident came to know itself and form its identity. In this course we will read selections from Said's monumental book alongside works of fiction and non-fiction to understand the historical roots of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim racism. We will also consider how fictional texts promote imperial ideology that serve to bolster western claims of cultural superiority and justify the colonization of non-western and non-white peoples. Finally, we will consider the utility of Orientalism almost 50 years after its publication. Texts may include, Orientalism, Othello, Passage to India, Reel Bad Arabs, Sand Opera, The Moonstone, King Solomon's Mines and Raiders of the Lost Ark.|#|LIT 182  CM|^|James Joyce|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|In this seminar we will read the major writings of the Irish author James Joyce, whose work was immensely influential on all 20th-century literature, in English and in other languages. We will begin with his collection of short stories, Dubliners, and with his quasiautobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The greater part of our class will be devoted to a detailed reading of Ulysses, his epic of the modern world. Time permitting, we will study excerpts of Finnegans Wake to establish strategies for reading this compendium of language and history. Offered every other year.

ML is becoming a familiar presence in our lives; computer scientists and developers introduce new applications every day for chatting with humans, recommending the best course of action, and making predictions about the future. In spite of all the press, ML remains daunting to non-specialists. This class seeks to mend this divide. This class will introduce ML concepts to students without prior experience and provide templates to get students working in ML right away. We will study and remake artworks by Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler, Sougwen Chung, Memo Akten, Helena Sarin, Tom White, and others. They will use techniques such as image segmentation, CycleGAN, pix2pix, and Tensorflow. Students will propose and work on a larger project in the last third of the class. Prerequisite: Any experience with programming, especially with Python

sciences. This course will introduce students to ways of thinking historically and culturally about sound and listening.
Sound studies is an inherently interdisciplinary field. While this course is grounded in media studies, it also intersects with
history, visual and performing art, architecture, music, cultural studies, anthropology and ethnography, as well as other
disciplines. The course will survey wide ranging topics and cultures including American and European industrialization;
rainforest soundscapes of Papua New Guinea; cassette sermons by Islamic preacher in Cairo, Egypt; avant-garde music
and DJ culture, to name a few.|#|MS  053  SC|^|Intro to Computational Media|^|SART|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|Intro to Computational Media explores code as an expressive medium for art and media makers.

Talking about games may conjure memories of Sonic and Mario, but gaming long precedes the digital forms we know today. Games are as old as any human art form and exist across every culture; playful behavior even precedes human language. In this course we will explore this question through a formal approach, focusing on game design as a creative and cultural practice with deep history and common principles that can be studied, practiced and effectively enacted. In this setting, game design does not require mastery of code nor a life-long obsession with games. Rather, like other aesthetic and experiential forms, game design has fundamentals that may apply across media, platforms and contexts.
|#|MS  059  SC|^|Intro to Python|^|SART|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|This is an introduction to computer programming that supports Scripps Collegeâs interdisciplinary vision. It is for everyone--visual designers, data scientists, and fine artists--who wants to create interactive media and computer graphics. This course links software concepts to principles of visual form, motion, and interaction. Students learn the fundamentals of Python programming (data structures, sequencing, selection and sorting, iteration and recursion, functions, object-oriented code) and use Processing.py to analyze and visualize data, generate drawings and sounds, manipulate images, create interactions for games, use network communication to collect data, and learn how to work with remote data to create environmental simulations.

Prior programming experience not required. This course satisfies the pre-requisite for DS2 in Scripps' Data Science minor.
|#|MS  071  PO|^|Conspiracy and Media|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course explores conspiracy narratives as modern, and perhaps post-modern cultural phenomena, that are inseparable from populist politics.  Living in the digital era, we must ask if the prevalence of conspiracy narratives now is a symptom of an epochal break, or rather, an intensification of a long 20th century phenomenon.We will deal with conspiracy narratives as they function as a form of social knowledge, albeit deeply flawed in many ways, that mobilize and structure a deep and virulent tradition of semiotic references.  This semiotic history is in turn grounded in popular literature and popular culture, especially visual culture, and cinema.  We will read conspiracy narratives in two different ways, that is as cultural historians (materialist and historical) with reference to film (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Four Feathers, The Matrix), literature (The Secret Agent, The Crying of Lot 49) and popular culture (eGames).

Weekly film screening required.|#|MS  146  PO|^|Temp. of the Moving Image|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course will concentrate on time as a category of analysis. Cinema possesses distinct affinities with the rationalization of labor and standardization of time that took place at the end of the nineteenth century, and yet it also provides a way of negotiating and resisting these processes, as it imagines alternative relations to standardized time. The course begins from the proposition that cinema provided a way for the twentieth century to re-think its changed relation to time after industrial modernity. Topics will include amnesia, boredom, duration, distraction, memory, the supposed death of cinema, real time, and simultaneity. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO.|#|MS  148D PO|^|Powers of Pleasure|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course interrogates John Fiske's contention that "pleasure may be the bait on the hook of hegemony, but it is always more than this; it always involves an element that escapes the system of power." With this claim in mind, we will: 1) evaluate key arguments in the field regarding pleasure's complicity with dominant ideological frameworks--particularly with regard to normative views of gender, race, class and sexuality; 2) consider ways in which the critique of pleasure itself may collude with patriarchal, racist, clasist and heteronormative systems of thought; and 3) explore the possibilities for pleasure to undermine established systems of power.

The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the 'binge model' of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory. Looking to psychoanalysis, existentialism, radical feminism, and Black Marxism, with supplemental examination of narrative, audience, and authorship studies, this course will aim to understand seriality as a textual, social, psychical, and political form. Prerequisites: one of MS  049  PO, MS  050  PO, MS  051  PO, MS 092  PO or equivalents. Letter grade only.|#|MS  152  SC|^|Navigating Digital Communities|^|SMS|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women; today, only 24% are women.

We will analyze the production and consumption of black representations in mainstream American media and explore the ways these processes influence basic assumptions about social roles, expectations, and norms that tend to inhere to concepts of 'blackness' and black popular culture. Students will be encouraged to develop a critical and political consciousness around historical formations of black identity, their own participation in embracing and/or resisting black representations, and the impact of black popular culture on their lived experiences. The course will be structured as a seminar and will emphasize collaborative thinking and discussion. Each class will feature a media component, a brief lecture putting the assigned media and readings into context, followed by collective discussion and contribution. Letter grade only.|#|MS  171  PO|^|A.I.: Humans and Machines|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|The rapid development of A.I. technologies, in which machines take on functions previously associated with human cognition, raises the question of what, if anything, is unique to human experience: a capacity for desire? humor? abstract thinking? aesthetic judgment? In this class we will examine how the boundary between the human and the machine appears as an object of investigation in contemporary literature and film, as well as in media theory and critical theory. These texts bear on topics that include surveillance and facial recognition; techno-utopianism and dystopianism; the algorithmic reproduction of bias; and the technological sublime. Students will work on creative research projects that may take a range of forms.|#|MS  172  HM|^|Third Cinema|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Emerging in Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s, the notion of Third Cinema takes its inspiration from the Cuban revolution and from Brazil's Cinema Novo. Third Cinema is the art of political film making and represents an alternative cinematic practice to that offered by mainstream film industries. This course explores the aesthetics of film making from a revolutionary consciousness in three regions: Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

More than presenting a series of individual case studies, we seek and forge pathways of understanding across time period and national divide, to articulate ways in which queerness?here broadly defined as the experience of 'otherness' in gender or sexual identity relative to societal expectations?inevitably enlivens and drives forward the very cultures and characters that ostensibly serve to suppress it. In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more.

Highlighting the possibility of social change through
education, this course explores Roxana Ngâs framework of âembodied learningâ as a
potentially decolonizing pedagogical praxis. Through readings, dialogue, and practices,
the class examines the hidden curriculum of different corporeal dualisms in classrooms,
the impact of (dis)embodiment on educational outcomes, and the transformative
possibility of embodied education for critical consciousness and social action. This class
investigates qi gong as an epistemological framework and an embodied practice related
to liberatory pedagogies. Rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, qi gong involves
breathing, awareness, and movement and centers interconnectedness as the basis for
its knowledge system. Combining discussion of readings and experiential practice, we
will engage in a community-engaged project that includes relational mindfulness, qi
gong, and other contemplative practices.

With this course we will explore the way in which ethics are debated and enacted in various organizational settings.The aim is to set up groundwork and establish a vocabulary for talking about ethics in the first place. Investigations
will follow a case study approach, centering on how ethics are applied within broad categories: science and technology; finance, business, and society; and the global world with its divisions and distinctions. People in all sorts of organizations
need to articulate what ethics are and to set up guidelines, since these do not just fall into place naturally. They must be intellectually constructed, hence the title, âethical constructs.â|#|ORST191  SC|^|Sr Thes: Organizational Studies|^|SOC|^|52.1003|^|SC|^|191.

What makes someones life go better or worse? What if someones life can be made to go better or at least prevented from going worse but only at the cost of undermining that persons autonomy, that is, by interfering with how the person has chosen to live her or his life?

History of Continental Philosophy, with focus themes of critique and alienation. Can living for a theory, or for a social or public concern, alienate one from oneâs own lived experience-for example, the experience of anxiety about finitude (Heidegger), or experience of responsibility in the face of the Other (Levinas)? Or is it specific kinds of social relation that are subject to critique as alienating, in dividing individuals against themselves (Hegel, Marx, Du Bois)? How would each question be answered in later forms of critique in the continental tradition-for example in Beauvoir, Foucault and Judith Butler on gender and sexuality? |#|PHIL100E CM|^|Special Topics: Hist of Philos|^|MPHI|^||^|CM|^|This course covers special topics in the history of philosophy.

A focus of the course will be ways in which biology has been used as a means to understand humans, in terms of their evolutionary history and more recently, in terms of genetics. We will examine some of the distinctive concepts and theoretical resources of the life sciences, like the theory of natural selection, the concept of species, reductionistic explanatory strategies and methodological worries about adaptationism. The course will examine how these conceptual and methodological issues are involved in many of the aspects of the life science that concern categories of difference in human societies, like race and gender.

Course is equivalent to PHIL126  CM.|#|PHIL121  SC|^|How Can You Believe That?|^|SPHI|^||^|SC|^|It's no surprise to learn that human beings believe (or at least claim to believe) remarkable things.  Sometimes  the  content  of  what  is  believed  is  strikingly  strange  (as  in  delusions),  sometimes  it  is the fact  that the evidential background is so hostile to the belief  (as  in  self-deception) that provokes our puzzlment  and  wonder. "How  can  they  believe  that?"  we  often  ask.  During  the  semester,  we  investigate various  forms  of  anomalous  beliefs  (e.g.,self-deceptive  and  delusional).  We  consider  the  many  ways  in which  such  beliefs  may  undermine  some  time-honored  views  of  the nature  of  belief.  We  take  up  and evaluate  the  success  of  competing  explanations  of  such  anomalous  beliefs.  We  spend  some  time  with accounts that hold that such apparent beliefs are, in fact, not beliefs at all but other sorts of psychological states. While we do consider some notable historical sources, most of our time is spent with works from the contemporary philosophical and cogitive scientific literatures.|#|PHIL124  HM|^|Morality and Self Interest|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^| A study of historical and contemporary arguments for the harmony of morality and enlightened self-interest, along with some of the main challenges raised against such arguments by their critics.

HSA Writing Intensive: No|#|PHIL134  CM|^|Topics: Metaphysics/Epistemology|^|MPHI|^|38.0101|^|CM|^|This course covers special topics in metaphysics and epistemology, considered broadly to include philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science. 

The course content changes each time the course is offered. Pre-requisite: one prior course in philosophy.  

The topics for fall 2024 will be "Political Epistemology" (section 01) and "Philosophy of Race" (section 02)

Political Epistemology:
Political epistemology is a branch of philosophy that sits at the intersection of epistemology, political theory, and political philosophy. Political epistemology considers how we acquire political knowledge and what we ought to believe in the political realm. Typical questions in political epistemology relate to whether we ought to defer to experts (or if we ought to think and reason for ourselves), how we ought to respond to political disagreement, the epistemic status of political beliefs, and so on. In addition to these questions, this course will also consider epistemic arguments for democracy, debates about political legitimacy under conditions of disagreement (and related notions such as public reason and political liberalism), and arguments for alternatives to (ordinary, electoral) democracy.   

Philosophy of Race:
This course is an overview of topics within the philosophy of race. We start with methodology and the metaphysics of race, exploring questions of âwhat is race?â âis race real?â âwhat kind of thing is race?â We then move on to social and political issues surrounding race. Topics that include: accounts of structural racism, racial justice, settler-colonialism and intersectionality.   |#|PHIL134  CM|^|Topics: Metaphysics/Epistemology|^|MPHI|^|38.0101|^|CM|^|This course covers special topics in metaphysics and epistemology, considered broadly to include philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.

How did the current international system come about and why does it look the way it does? What are the central institutions and structures that shape global politics and how do they operate? And how should we make sense of the numerous ?global? issues facing states and societies? To answer these questions, this course will highlight a diverse range of approaches to understanding global politics-- including mainstream, interpretivist, post-/ de-colonial, non-Western, and indigenous perspectives-- as well as core concepts, such as the state, sovereignty, and power. We will put these concepts and perspectives to use in order to make sense of a number of contemporary issues in global politics, including identity and difference, international order, climate change, migration, violence and security, and human rights, paying special attention to the role of imperialism and colonialism in making global politics what it is today.

|#|POLI103  SC|^|Decolonizations|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|Recent years have witnessed a renewed wave of calls for ?decolonization,? ranging from appeals to ?decolonize the university? to the repatriation of Indigenous lands. But what does decolonization mean and how might it be achieved? In this course, we will take up these questions from a global and interdisciplinary perspective, exploring their meaning and significance across a range of contexts to better understand how colonial and racializing forms of power have been contested and resisted. As such, we will explore numerous topics including historical struggles against colonial rule and racialized domination, decolonial political thought, Indigenous politics, racialization and global antiracist movements, and how global politics might be decolonized. Course meets Social Science and Race and Ethnic Studies general education requirements.|#|POLI105  SC|^|NATO in the 21st Century|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is often referred to as history's most successful alliance.

|#|POLI107  SC|^|Race & Colnialism in Glbal Poltc|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|How have race and colonialism shaped and affected global politics? Why do they still matter in global politics today in a supposedly ?postcolonial? world? In this course, we will explore the many ways in which the history and experiences of colonialism and racism have structured and continue to shape global politics. As such, we will consider how many of the structures and institutions of global politics?such as international organizations, international law, and global capitalism?were built to reinforce forms of colonial domination and White supremacy. We will then examine how these structures and institutions continue to reproduce racialized hierarchies and inequalities, and how these forms of inequality and domination have been resisted and contested. To do this we will draw on postcolonial, decolonial, and anti-racist approaches coming from work in political science and international relations, social and political theory, history, and literature. We will also examine a number of historical and contemporary cases including the Haitian Revolution, efforts to build an anti-colonial world order in the mid-twentieth century, ongoing settler colonialism in Turtle Island/North America, and development programs in the Global South. |#|POLI108  SC|^|Political & Monetary Europe|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|Following World War II, most of the states of western Europe - including most prominently France and the Federal Republic of Germany - embarked on a process of reconciliation and economic integration.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.|#|POLI121  SC|^|Practicing Abolition Democracy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|Ending Mass Incarceration.

We survey past and current formations of political organizing to combat the problems of environmental inequality including but not limited to climate change. How do politically engaged organizations and movements interrogate the social scientific evidence concerning environmental inequality and how do they combat it? How do they understand the political, social, economic, and environmental forces including but not limited to environmental racism that produce environmental inequalities, and how do they incorporate their analyses into their political campaigns? How do political movements seeking to transform environmental inequality incorporate theories of transformative social change that take into account multiple axes of difference and domination including but not limited to race, gender, class, and nationality?|#|POLI125  SC|^|Voting, Campaigning & Elections|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course is designed to provide a strong theoretical background in understanding voting behavior, elite campaign strategies, and electoral systems.

Prerequisite: 3 or equivalent.|#|POLI130  SC|^|Intro to Political Economy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course explores the ways in which the study of politics and economics are interrelated, and introduces students to several models that attempt to explain and analyze the ways in which politics and economics affect each other. These include public choice theory, game theory, new institutionalism, and neo-Marxism. Open to first-year students.|#|POLI131  PO|^|Unbridled Power? US Presidency|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Though the executive branch is relegated to the loosely defined second article of the U.S. Constitution, presidential power has greatly expanded over time and in the process reshaped American politics to revolve around presidential initiative. In the contemporary era, coequal branches of the government defer to the president, while voters look to the president to solve a snowballing set of public problems. However, the rise in executive power has not satisfied expectations, leading to the confounding dual problem of presidents purportedly having too much power in some domains, while still struggling to adequately fix society's most pressing demands. This course will explore the aforementioned conundrum and the historical development of the U.S. executive branch, spotlighting the important contributions- and idiosyncrasies- of every U.S. president. |#|POLI133  PO|^|Law and Politics|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Law and Politics. This course examines the intersection of law, politics, and policy in the American context.  It investigates the opportunities and pitfalls of legal advocacy, the relationship between litigation and legislation and the nature of judicial interpretation and policy-making.  In doing so, it explores the ways in which legal decisions and processes shape and are shaped by political and institutional conditions. Prerequisites: POLI003  PO.|#|POLI134  SC|^|Infrastructures of Justice|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This research seminar focuses on the question, "Do markets result in just outcomes?" Most answers to this question seem to be virtually predetermined, but focus little attention on the question, "Under what conditions do markets result in just or unjust outcomes?" The premise here, to be explored through the students' original case study research projects, is that markets as deeply embedded societal structures simply perpetuate underlying social conditions, be they just or unjust. Examples include white supremacy, patriarchy, land and asset distribution derived from colonial and slave plantation systems. However, markets can also reinforce social justice whether through, for example, community-based development projects or marketable permits for industrial pollution. |#|POLI135  PO|^|Policy Implementation/Evaluation|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Policy Implementation and Evaluation.

We will address these issues in an intergenerational partnership with elder co-learners from Pilgrim Place and other elders similarly committed to social justice.  Students in this course will register for a 0.5 course credit (4-7 hours per week) co-requisite internship in which they will explore alternative food practices through community engagement projects.|#|POLI140  SC|^|Intro to Political Theory|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This survey course examines the evolution of central political concepts in the western tradition through close readings of major texts in political theory.  Students will be introduced to the political thought of authors such as Plato, Machiavelli, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Mill, as well as contemporary writings.  Special attention will be given to changing understandings of liberty and authority, equality and rights, legitimacy, and democracy.  |#|POLI142  SC|^|Marxism and Post-Marxism|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|In American public discourse, news media, and academic institutions, political discussion is almost always circumscribed by the limits of liberal ideology.  The language of political liberalism is so ubiquitous that many students will be unaware of how their own moral sensibilities and political intuitions are products of liberal thought.  In contrast, this course investigates Marxist and Post-Marxist political theory to explore radical perspectives on politics, economics, culture, and power. A basic familiarity with liberal political philosophy, while helpful, is not required.
|#|POLI143  PO|^|Projecting Power|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|How do stories influence our understanding of politics? What role do state actors play in shaping the cinematic narratives we see on screen? This seminar will introduce students to the field of political science by placing American and international films in conversation with scholarship on power, politics, and storytelling. Each week we will study a film, read related research, and analyze how one informs our understanding of the other. The course will cover ethnic politics, broadly conceived with a particular focus on civil disobedience, protests and political violence. Related topics may include immigration, crime and the state, and urban politics. We will consider a range of questions including, how do stories influence our sense of self, community and nation? How do filmmaking techniques (e.g. cinematography, casting, sound design) influence which people and issues become salient? How do aesthetic and narrative choices affect attitudes about the social order and who is deserving of power? Through close readings of films, social science, and media studies scholarship, this course will enable students to study key political science concepts, the institution of cinema, and how stories make meaning. Letter grade only.|#|POLI143  SC|^|Civil Liberties/Fundamntl Rights|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|While civil liberties protect the individual from coercive power by outlining what the government must not do, civil rights protect the individual from coercive power by obligating the government to take positive action.  This course examines civil liberties and civil rights in American public law and jurisprudence.  
|#|POLI144  SC|^|Legal Storytelling & Rule of Law|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course examines the competing claims of "legalism" (with its emphasis on formal rules and neutral principles) and "legal storytelling" (which prioritizes subjective experiences of the law as actually practiced) regarding questions of race, gender, and justice in American constitutional law.  Through close readings of both literary and legal texts, the course adopts a humanistic approach to legal scholarship, locating the force of law within its discursive and rhetorical dimensions.  Topics to be discussed include: rights to privacy, sexuality and reproductive freedom; sexual harassment and racist speech; anti-discrimination, integration, and affirmative action.  
|#|POLI145  SC|^|Race, Violence, and the Law|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context. Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration. |#|POLI148  PO|^|Comparative Social Policy|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|There is a tendency in some corners of American politics to gaze longingly across the Atlantic and wonder: why don't we have universal health care?  Free college tuition?  State-subsidized child care?  The perception is that Europeans, via robust welfare states, enjoy social benefits that remain out of reach for Americans (or at least those Americans who cannot procure them from the market).  This class takes a comparative approach to social policy in order to better identify why there are differences in approaches to the welfare state, not just between Europe and the US, but within Europe as well.  In addition to exploring key cases and areas of policy coverage, we will also consider how policy feedback loops, neoliberalism, globalization, and demographic change (in particular, aging and immigration) all affect the scope and stability of the welfare state on both sides of the Atlantic.|#|POLI150  SC|^|Intro to Public Policy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course addresses the public policy process through policy formulation, implementation, and oversight in the United States. We will cover various dynamics of both formalized political institutions, particularly evinced through federalism and the separation of powers, as well as special interests and the prominence of "The Third House." The first half of the semester will focus on processes, while the second half will evaluate government policies surrounding specific issues including climate change, poverty, and violence. |#|POLI151  SC|^|Women and Public Policy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course addresses social dynamics related to femininity and masculinity and the consequent politics and policy choices that evolve from notions of difference between men and women. We explore gendered representation as a central category of analysis, and focus on the concept of womenhood in the American policy process.|#|POLI152  PO|^|Political Dialogue & Resistance|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Why are some political disputes settled through dialogue and negotiation, while others escalate into protest or even political violence?  How does the process of political engagement affect outcomes?  How is the decision to talk or to fight, and the manner in which one talks or fights - mediated by identity, networks, and culture? And in what ways does past participation in contentious politics affect future political engagement?  This class explores these questions through theoretical readings, case studies from around the world, documentaries, negotiation simulations, and conversations with practitioners. Letter grade only.|#|POLI154  SC|^|Future of Higher Education|^|ALS|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This seminar considers the past, present and possible future organization of higher education in the United States. We will examine the origins of its current organization, the circumstances under which these features arose, and how issues such as the cost, access, and technological change are influencing debates about its future.|#|POLI155  SC|^|Marginalized Communities|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course explores definitions, mechanisms, and experiences of marginalized communities in the United States, with specific attention paid to racial minority groups, women and children, immigrants, the LGBT community, and the poor. What hurdles exist for these communities as they attempt to navigate social, political and economic processes in the US?  How do federal, state and local policies hurt or bolster these communities? Readings will be drawn from across the social sciences. |#|POLI156  PO|^|Politics of East Europe|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Russia's brutal 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent war have brought Eastern Europe back into the headlines. What makes the eastern half of Europe distinct? East Central Europe and the Balkans have long been seen as the "other" owing to their long decades under imperial rule and communism, and their post-communist experience of ethnic conflict and state disintegration.  In this course, we will consider the factors that have shaped the contemporary politics and international relations of this fascinating region. We will cover topics such as communist legacies, post-communist democratization, nationalism and ethnic conflict, European Union and NATO enlargement, and current challenges such as populism and democratic regression. We will devote significant attention to Ukraine given recent events. In addition to scholarly articles and books, we will engage with films from the region. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: POLI 008  PO.|#|POLI158  PO|^|Democratic Decay|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|In 1989, Francis Fukuyama famously declared liberal democracy the 'final form of human government.' Thirty years later, in every region of the world, liberal democracy is in retreat. Why? This class takes a comparative approach to understanding democratic decay, drawing from cases in Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Starting with basic theories of democracy, we will explore the role that institutions, nationalism, populism, capitalism, demographic change, and technological change play in testing the foundations of liberal democratic states. Letter grade only.|#|POLI160  PO|^|Comparative European Politics|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|This course explores the three key political challenges facing Europeans in the post-war era: what is Europe, where are its boundaries, and who is European?  Topics include the emergence, expansion and possible contraction of the EU/euro zone, immigration and multiculturalism, the return of nationalism and, populism, political realignment, the collapse of the post-war social contract state-society relations, and the challenges of national vs. supranational governance. Prerequisites: POLI005  PO.|#|POLI161  PO|^|Comparative Social Policy|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|There is a tendency in some corners of American politics to gaze longingly across the Atlantic and wonder: why don't we have universal health care?

Through a combination of film analysis and political theory, students will examine the socio-political themes, cultural contexts, and philosophical underpinnings present in Studio Ghibli works. The films will serve as a vehicle for exploring key political science concepts such as power, organization, agency, rights, among others. Both films and readings will be tied to contemporary political events and political science debates throughout the semester.|#|POLI167  JT|^|Arab Spring & Remaking Mid East|^|CJT|^||^|PO|^|Why did the Arab Spring end in authoritarian reassertion or state disintegration (with Tunisia as the sole success)?  Starting with the lineages of state formation and divergent trajectories of populist-authoritarianism, rentierism, praetorianism, and Islamist-secular polarization, we explore how various Arab states adapted to challenges in the 1980s-1990s and explore what led to the 2011 uprisings.  We ask what structural legacies and key choices set states on track for democratization, coups, civil war or monarchical reassertion after 2011, assess the influence of outside actors, and consider prospects for stability and democracy in the region. Letter grade only. |#|POLI168  PO|^|Int'l Relations of East Asia|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Study of historical and contemporary security issues in East Asia.  Includes international relations theory, traditional and non-traditional security, regionalism and policymaking.|#|POLI169  PO|^|Foreign Interventions in Africa|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Probably more than any other continent, Sub-Saharan Africa has been the theater of repeated and multiple foreign interventions - military, diplomatic, economic, and political -since the 1960s. What are the rationales for these interventions? Who are their main actors? And how do they shape African politics? This class seeks to answer these questions by focusing first on (1) Cold-war related interventions; (2) foreign-aid conditionality and democracy promotion; and (3) post 9/11 security sector assistance. Most of the courses' emphasis is on this last period and security interventions with a focus on Trans-Saharan and Horn-of-Africa countries. Letter grade only.|#|POLI171  PO|^|Democracy, Human Rights And USFP|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Can the U.S. be a force for good in the world? This course will examine how the U.S. promotes democracy and human rights as part of its foreign policy--and where, why, and when it does not. In so doing, it engages themes such as the international diffusion of human rights and democracy norms, the determinants of U.S. foreign policy, political and economic conditionality, "liberal" intervention and nation-building, the role of Conress, and support for NGOs and civil society. We will also consider the role of other democracy- and human rights-promoting states and international organizations. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: POLI005  PO, or POLI007  PO, or POLI008  PO.|#|POLI173  PO|^|Congress and U.S. Foreign Policy|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|The U.S. Constitution gives substantial foreign policy powers to Congress. Yet, how, when, and why Congress uses these powers has varied greatly. Drawing on scholarly articles, case studies, primary source material, and simulations, we will explore the foundations and history of Congressional activism on foreign affairs in areas such as war powers, human rights, and international trade. The course will have a practical component to help prepare students interested in Congressional internships. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: POLI003  PO or POLI007  PO.|#|POLI173  SC|^|Changing Selves, Changing Worlds|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|Remaking the Self and Changing the World: Social Movements in the Middle East and United States

How do social movements change the world by changing ideas, identities, and norms about the public good? How do they introduce new actors and forms of activism into the political sphere? How do activists frame and mobilize social norms and identities, tap emotions, and build new embodied and virtual networks for political goals, and what makes them succeed or fail? This class explores these questions in comparative context, through cases spanning the Christian Right and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in the United States, Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Syria, religious and gendered activism in Saudi Arabia, Palestinian militants, and transnational human rights networks.|#|POLI176  PO|^|Conflict and Cooperation in IR|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore the various causes and consequences of war.

Letter grade only.|#|POLI179A PO|^|U.S., Israel, and Palestinians|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Israel and the Palestinians have long been the focus of U.S. foreign policy. In this course, we will survey the history of U.S. policy toward Israel-Palestine--including U.S. peace diplomacy over successive decades--all while trying to explain why a modestly-sized territory of 14 million people has played such an outsize role in the American national security imagination. In so doing, we will seek to understand both the making of U.S. foreign policy and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.|#|POLI180  PO|^|Comparative & Int'l Poli Econ|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|This course introduces students to political-economy theories used in comparative politics and international relations.  Topics include theories of: the state, collective action and public goods, international organizations such as the World Bank, international economic relations, development as an international regime and others.  Each topic is treated theoretically and empirically, including instruction on budget analysis (for theories of the state) and balance of payment analysis. Prerequisites: POLI005  PO or POLI008 PO. Letter grade only.|#|POLI180  SC|^|Research Design|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|This course provides an introduction to methodology in the social sciences generally, and political science in particular. The aim is to enhance understanding of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of political phenomena, and to assist students in employing suitable methodologies when conducting research of their own. Scripps Politics majors should plan to take this course in either their sophomore or junior year as preparation for writing their senior theses.  |#|POLI181  PO|^|Ghibli and Foundations Poli Sci|^|PPOL|^|45.1001|^|PO|^|This upper-division interdisciplinary course explores the "big ideas" raised in political science through the world of Studio Ghibli, a renowned Japanese animation studio. Through a combination of film analysis and political theory, students will examine the socio-political themes, cultural contexts, and philosophical underpinnings present in Studio Ghibli works. The films will serve as a vehicle for exploring key political science concepts such as power, organization, agency, rights, among others. Both films and readings will be tied to contemporary political events and political science debates throughout the semester.|#|POLI184  SC|^|Qual App Comp Political Analysis|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|This is an advanced seminar that introduces majors to debates and methods in qualitative approaches to analyzing and explaining political phenomena. We will focus on what the comparative method allows us to know about politics, and study how comparativists pose and answer research questions and approach causality, through case studies, comparative historical analysis, process tracing, discourse analysis, and interpretive methods. Readings will pair methods with literatures on topics like democratization, social movements, ethnic conflict, nationalism, and political violence, and students will produce original research plans. Recommended for students planning to write theses in comparative politics.|#|POLI187B SC|^|Race, Gender & Welfare Politics|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|187B. Race, Gender and Welfare State Politics.
This course examines the role of American political institutions in shaping welfare and social policy. Focusing on the effects of race, class, and gender on the development of welfare, this course will examine the ideas, values and institutions that comprise the American welfare state.  D. Bensonsmith.
|#|POLI187D SC|^|Gender Politics & Public Policy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|187D. Gender Politics and Public Policy.
The purpose of this course is to address how government policies construct gender in the United States. Students will examine a variety of policy issues and domains in an effort to achieve a better understanding of how gender functions in the policy arena, affecting race and class dynamics in the United States. D. Bensonsmith.
|#|POLI187G SC|^|Voting Rights Practicum|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|This is a research practicum, which means that students will have an opportunity to be part of a team doing applied voting rights research. The class will provide students with a solid grasp of the factors that affect the ability of citizens to meaningfully participate in governance. They will learn and then apply the electoral equity model. Be forewarned: the model is complex and includes multiple, interconnected parts that interact in different ways in different setting. |#|POLI187M SC|^|Feminist Political Thought|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|Feminist political thinkers shed light on the role of gender in shaping our social position and experience of the world. In this course, we will read authors who take up questions of gender-based oppression in order to make visible marginalized persons and groups, and seek out practices of political empowerment and solidarity. We consider themes and episodes including the women's, black feminist, and Chicana liberation movements; the evolving problem of gender and capitalism - from women's relegation to the domestic sphere to the contemporary exploitation of care work in neoliberal economies; racialized sexuality and governmental power; experiences of inheritance, depression, anxiety, and anger; and reparative strategies of care and resistance.|#|POLI187N SC|^|Global Migration and Citizenship|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|This course provides a survey of interdisciplinary approaches to the study of borders, migration, and citizenship.  We will examine current debates around immigration policy in the United States, militarized border regimes in Latin America, exploitation of Black migrants in Europe, and the racial politics of citizenship in the ?Black Mediterranean.?  Students will explore the role of U.S. foreign policy and international financial institutions in creating the conditions for forced displacement and mass migration. The seminar also draws on Black feminist, Black queer, and anti-colonial thought to explore the prevalence of anti-Black and anti-Indigenous discourses in Latinx movements for migrant justice. By drawing on specific case studies and recent works in political theory, this course invites students to consider how capitalism, U.S. imperialism, settler colonialism, and anti-Blackness complicate cherished understandings of justice, equality, and citizenship. Throughout the semester, students will learn what it means to think theologically about movement, borders, nations, sovereignty, and western constructions of the ?human.?          |#|POLI189F PO|^|Pol Inequality in US|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|This course explores the durable coexistence of democracy and political inequality in U.S. politics, from the Colonial era to the present day. We will use political science, sociology, history, economics, and legal texts to better understand the vicissitudes of group-based political status. Special attention is devoted to race, ethnicity, migration, economic class, sex, gender, political parties, interest groups, social movements, and geography.|#|POLI189G PO|^|Negotiating U.S. Policyscape|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Americans are reputed to show disfavor toward government compared to our counterparts in other developed democracies. And yet, there are over 93,000 governmental entities with jurisdiction over 330 million Americans. This enormous scale of government not only belies the myth of a libertine America but suggests Americans cannot get enough government. What gives? This is a unique course that problematizes basic issues of public policy in relation to the historical development of the American state. It combines two subfields in political science which are generally not paired together (political history and policy studies), straddling cerebral concepts with creative case studies. The novel nature of the course exposes students to big ideas about statebuilding, while also preparing them for professional graduate degrees in public policy.|#|POLI189P PO|^|Education and Democracy|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Struggles over control of public education are central to the project of democracy and its promise of inclusion, equality, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. In this course we will read political theorists and actors who take up heated questions concerning the content and reach of public education. The first half of the course engages ideal models of education proposed by liberal, democratic, and radical theorists. The second half of the course looks at how these ideals are taken up by social movement actors in the United States from the era of civil rights and massive resistance to racial integration, through the rise of neoliberal reform and increased school policing, to contemporary curriculum battles and attacks on LGBT youth in schools.|#|POLI190  SC|^|Senior Seminar|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|Students will assess goals for thesis and pursue them via active research and writing, become familiar with conventions of research article writing in political science, learn how to craft an argument situated in an academic literature, and learn how to revise an argument to make it more persuasive.|#|POLI190B PO|^|Sr Sem: Comparativ/Intl Politics|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Explores the question of what can be legally owned, confiscated, or discarded in the 21st century and how this shapes state forms and transnational capitalism.

We begin each historical period with a general background that will allow us to analyze different cultural expressions (literary texts, films, architecture, photography and music)in their original context. The course focuses on several overarching topics, including the creation of the modern Brazilian nation, the cultural encounters between indigenous, Portuguese, and African peoples, and its complex political history. Given that Brazil has such a vast territory, we will also focus on different regions and their contributions to the countrys cultural richness.
|#|PORT001  PZ|^|Introductory Portuguese 1|^|ZMLL|^||^|PZ|^|This is the first semester of a two-semester introductory course in Brazilian Portuguese. It
uses a communicative approach to language learning with an emphasis on interactive
activities and connections to the Brazilian cultural context. Students develop conversational
skills and knowledge of grammatical structures and vocabulary they can apply to real-world
settings. This course is an ideal choice for students without a background in Spanish (or
other Romance languages), students who have never taken a language course before, or
those who wish to have more exposure to the language and a solid base in grammar before
transitioning into the intermediate level.|#|PORT002  PZ|^|Introductory Portuguese 2|^|ZMLL|^||^|PZ|^|This is the second of a two-semester introductory course in Brazilian Portuguese, using a communicative approach to language learning with an emphasis on interactive activities.

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion. This class examines the political contributions of minority groups in shaping and broadening American democracy. |#|POST030  PZ|^|Intro to Comparative Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This introductory course focuses on explaining political events and processes - like civil war, regime change, revolution, and development - that we regularly read and hear about in the news.

The course is divided into three roughly equal-sized sections. The first section offers an introduction to the two philosophical/theoretical traditions in international relations thought: rationalism (and its realist and liberal variants) and social constructivism (and its statist and global variants). The second section covers a series of significant periods in international political history from the emergence of the modern system of states in Europe in the sixteenth century to the end of the Cold War. The third section investigates various issues in contemporary international politics.|#|POST050  PZ|^|Politicl Thought East&West Intro|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Political Thought East and West: Intro to Political Philosophy

The study of political philosophy focuses on broad assumptions concerning human nature and the character of community organizations that regular activities and seek to promote happiness. These assumptions, structures and goals vary through time and across cultures. This class examines the texts of major theorists representing European, Chinese, Islamic, and Indian political thought and compare their arguments concerning the nature of freedom, justice, equality, authority and responsibility among other fundamental concepts. |#|POST101  PZ|^|US Campaigns and Elections|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course provides an overview of campaigns and elections in the American context. Topics include political parties, primaries and general elections, voting behavior and turnout, media coverage, campaign finance, election law and prospects for electoral reform, state and local elections, issues and candidate evaluation, and gendered dimensions of electoral politics.|#|POST106  PZ|^|Law and Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the intersection of law,
politics, and policy in the American context. Combining normative and empirical
approaches, we will investigate theories of statutory interpretation, the opportunities
and pitfalls of legal advocacy, the relationship between litigation and legislation,
and the nature of judicial policy-making. Pre-requisites: PS 60 or 10a (or other
intro policy or intro to American politics course) or permission of instructor.|#|POST124  PZ|^|Chinese Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course provides an overview of China's political system. It begins with a brief historical overview of China's political development since 1949. The remainder of the course examines the institutional features of the current political system and the key challenges facing the CCP leadership focusing on the prospects of political reform. By applying concepts and theories in comparative politics, we will investigate important issues in Chinese politics, including political selection, state-business relations, protests movements, political participation, public opinion, and media and Internet control. Although students are recommended to have taken comparative politics, there are no prerequisites for this course. |#|POST140  HM|^|Global Environmental Politics|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Analyzes the political dynamics driving global environmental problems and current attempts to address them.

What is ethics? To whom and for whom am I responsible? Where do these responsibilities come from?  What do the various religious traditions of the world have to say about these questions?  To what extent do they lay claim to the question of ethics, a question on which the philosophical traditions also have a lot to say?  Do religious traditions generally say the same thing about morality, or do they differ on ethical fundamentals?  In this course we begin to think about these difficult questions, through philosophy, religious text and literature. (PRT)|#|RLST045  CM|^|Sikhism|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|Sikhism arose in North India in the 15th century, and has since become a global religion with approximately 30 million adherents. This course will consider the historical context of Sikhism's emergence and development in the Punjabi homeland; Sikh theology, ritual, and practice; and the Sikh diaspora in the U.S. and elsewhere. Within these areas of inquiry we will also engage with key themes from the tradition, including scripture and authority; martyrdom and violence; identity (from gender and sexuality to caste, class, and the turban); and politics (including Partition, the Khalistan movement, 1984, and Sikhs in post-9/11 America). We will watch several films and will visit a local Gurudwara (a Sikh place of worship).|#|RLST048  PO|^|Nourishing Life|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|"Nourishing Life" translates yangshen, a phrase early Chinese thinkers coined in their debates on how to best care for oneself. The techniques, spanning from dietary and hygiene observances, physical exercises, alchemy, to moral conduct and mental training, often seek to harmonize body and mind, as well as the cosmos. The arts of nourishing life are also elaborated in later Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist literature, as well as in East Asian writings. Through close readings of selected primary sources in English translation (e.g. Mencius, Zhuangzi, Dogen's "Instruction to the Cook," and a Tibetan tantric meditation manual), we will analyze the different recipes proposed by East Asian thinkers for prolonging life and attaining health, and the different biological, ethical, philosophical, psychological, and at times spiritual assumptions undergirding their concepts of health and wellbeing. |#|RLST049  PO|^|Buddhist Meditation|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course offers an in-depth introduction to cross-cultural practices of Buddhist meditation in Asia. It will look at calm-insight and mindfulness practices in Southeast Asia, contemplative and visualization techniques in China, Zen communities of East Asia, mandala visualization in Tibet, and finally, the global "mindfulness" of socially engaged Buddhists, The course will include one weekly lab practicum where students meditate under the instructor's supervision.|#|RLST056  CM|^|Jews Among Greeks and Romans|^|MRLS|^||^|CM|^|For roughly 600 years (300 BCE-300 CE), Greeks and Romans ruled over the land and peoples of the Mediterranean. Jews were one of those peoples. This class examines how Jews experienced Greek and Roman rule and the political, social, and cultural forces that resulted in new ways of being Jewish. During the course, students will engage mostly with the primary sources, literary texts, inscriptions, papyri, coins, and other material objects, in order to understand Jews living among Greeks and Romans. Particular attention will be devoted to the ways in which Jews used religious ideas and practices as ways to accommodate and also resist the political and cultural hegemony of the world in which they lived.|#|RLST058  CM|^|End of the World As We Know It|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|Apocalypticism remains one of the most potent and enduring dimensions of human religiosity. Apocalyptic symbolism has been implicated in the rise and renewal of major religious traditions, revolutions (of both secular and religious varieties), and major historical events. The events of the apocalypse have also provided material for some of the most creative expressions of artistic, literary, and cultural phenomena throughout human history. This course explores some of the ways in which the apocalyptic is expressed across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and beyond while also addressing key theoretical concerns in apocalyptic studies.

|#|RLST060  SC|^|Feminist Interpret of the Bible|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Sampling from various literary families of the Bible, this course will carry out feminist analysis of biblical texts and explore their feminist interpretations and their political motivations. Through the exploration of different feminist perspectives, methods, contexts and social locations, the course will underline how these various factors shape feminist interpretations of the Bible.

|#|RLST061  SC|^|New Testament Christian Origins|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|Students will examine the New Testament and other Christian literature of the first and second centuries in the context of the history, culture, religion, and politics of the late ancient Mediterranean.  The course will emphasize analytical reading, the varieties of early Christian expression and experience, and key scholarly and theoretical issues. 
|#|RLST085  SC|^|Conquered Colonized Christianity|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course explores the history of conquered and colonized Christianities in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and America between the first and twentieth century through approaches that draw on gender, cultural, and post-/decolonial theory. The course engages Christian identity formation when articulated from political, ethno-racial, religious, or ideological vulnerability and raises the recurrent question: is Christianity in power authentic Christianity? Suitable for first-years.|#|RLST090  SC|^|Early Christian Bodies|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|In this course we will explore physical religious behavior, understandings of the human body, and interpretations of bodily experience among early Christian men and women.  The course will emphasize critical analysis of primary sources, secondary scholarship, and contemporary theoretical approaches concerning gender, sexuality, martyrdom, pilgrimage, asceticism, virginity, fasting, and monasticism. 
|#|RLST092  SC|^|Intro to Early Christianities|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|Through study of ancient texts and monuments, this course explores the diverse forms of Christianity that arose in the first six centuries CE. We will pay particular attention to political, cultural, and social expressions of early Christianity, including: martyrdom, asceticism, religious conflict (with Jews, pagans, and heretics), and political ideology. 
|#|RLST093  CM|^|Religion & Politics in Israel|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state. This course will examine how these two contrasting and sometimes competing understandings, the religiously particular and the secularly universal, have helped to shape Israeli history and society. The first unit of the course will survey the historical and religious connections between the people of Israel and the land of Israel, Jewish political theory, and how modern Zionist thinkers appropriated, modified, and rejected these understandings in developing their rationales for the creation of a Jewish state. The second unit will examine how religion influenced some of the founding policies and institutions of the state, including the Status Quo agreement, Law of Return, and the rabbinate. The final unit will examine the connection between religion and politics in contemporary Israel, and explore the complex and sometimes contested ways in which this connection manifests itself in family law, military service, the administration of holy places, the governing of territories and conflict with Palestinians.|#|RLST093A SC|^|Mod Mid East Lit & Films|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|Modern Middle East LIterature and Films. The goal of this course is to read and critically examine a range of literary writings from the modern Middle East with a view to gain insights into changing conceptions of self, society and culture. Among the literary themes taken up are those pertaining to gender, sexuality, war, migration, religion, and 'East-West' relations. Emphasis is assigned to modern prose translations (i.e., genres of novella, novel, short story), but importance also will be given to poetry and film.  |#|RLST095  SC|^|Jesus,Paul,Early Chrstn Sexualty|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Jesus, Paul, and Early Christian Sexualities. This course investigates a constellation of early Christian sexualities and their relation to Jesus and Paul, arguably the most influential figures in the trajectory of the religion. We will examine a range of texts, beginning with early Christian writings about Jesus and Paul's own writings, up to the tenth century and written in an impressive array of languages (available in English translation), including Greek, Latin, Coptic, Arabic, and Syriac. Our outlook will be primarily driven by critical-theoretical methods for the study of religion, including feminism, queer theory, post-/decolonial critique, disability studies, and discourse analysis and will have one eye firmly fixed on how Jesus and Paul as figures and/or writers continue to influence society and sexuality today. |#|RLST096  SC|^|Eros & Sex: Antiquity/Byzantium|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course traces the relationship between eros and human sexuality from Greek antiquity (ca.600 BCE) through the middle Byzantine era (ca.

The emphasis of this class explores how racial, gendered, and economic inequities construct narratives of deviance that create unique burdens for Black women who are punished for transgressing dominant norms of white middle-class society. Students will examine teachings of sin, sacrifice, and surrogacy and analyze how these church theologies may (or may not) reproduce carceral logic. Students will also interrogate ethical practices, such as politics of respectability, that are harmful and condemn Black mothers' moral agency. Specifically, participants will explore real-life issues, such as the criminalization of poverty and welfare reform, and consider how social and ecclesial appraisals construct poor Black women as unworthy of moral concern. Based on this critical study of adverse church teachings and practices, students will construct helpful ways to apply liberatory womanist religious values with abolitionist principles to shift narratives of deviance and create moral re-appraisals that advocate for the flourishing of Black women beyond punishment and prisons.|#|RLST102  CM|^|Hinduism & South Asian Culture|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|Explores the main ideas, practices, and cultural facets of Hinduism and Indian culture.

It will also treat some of the popular practices and culture of China.|#|RLST107  PO|^|Buddhist Modernity in China|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|During China's transition from imperial rule to modern state, traditional religions were challenged with the seemingly inevitable fate of being erased by modernizing and secularizing forces. To meet intellectual, social and political challenges that included state persecution. Buddhist leaders poured their efforts into rearticulating Buddhism under a spectrum of approaches defined by two polarities: (1) conservatives who emphasized restoring Tradition and (2) progressives who favored modernization. We will look at the Buddhist adaptations to modernity, particularly the modern state, from the perspective of religious history, exploring how metaphors of "Tradition" versus "Innovation" can be used toward the preservation and revitalization of religion. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: Any previous course in Religious Studies or Asian Studies.|#|RLST111  PO|^|Theology, Morality and Policy|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will examine tensions between law and morality within the context of survival and the criminalization of impoverished Black motherhood in the U.S. carceral state. We will explore the ways in which these social dilemmas correspond to public policy paradoxes that assign punitive consequences to target populations considered unworthy of moral concern. Students will also consider the ways in which Christian teachings and practices work together with societal perceptions and policies to reproduce punitive harms that cause individual blame rather than systemic accountability. Finally, students are encouraged to reimagine these retributive teachings and practices within Church and society to realize emancipatory visions for abolition and human flourishing, particularly for poor Black mothers.|#|RLST114  HM|^|Prophecy, Apocalypse|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course looks at American configurations of the End Times, including, but not limited to, the 2012 end of the Mayan calendar, Ghost Dance religions, technocalpyses, The Church Universal and Triumphant, Heavens Gate, the Left Behind books and movies, and varied interpretations of book of Revelation in the Christian Bible.  Students taking this course will become familiar with various forms of American apocalyptic thinking as well as literature from new religious movement or cult scholarship, in order to explore the enduring appeal of End Time scenarios and to question what makes these scenarios persuasive to individuals at varied points in American history.

Students will gain a holistic understanding of the Shari'a's major doctrines and practices, ranging from laws of worship and ritual purity to institutions of marriage, slavery, war, and economic welfare. We will examine the broader historical and sociological contexts in which Islamic legal schools evolved, from 7th century Arabia to colonialism and the modern nation-state. The second half of the course will focus on the Shari'a's tumultuous relationship with liberal democracy and secularism. Students will critically assess the cultural and normative presuppositions informing discourses on the relationship between Islamic law and terrorism, women's rights, and the treatment of minorities. The course carries no prerequisites and is open to all majors. No background knowledge of Islam is assumed.|#|RLST128  PO|^|The Religion of Islam|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|The Religion of Islam. Introduction to Islamic tradition: its scripture, beliefs and practices and the development of Islamic law, theology, philosophy and mysticism.

Benjamin, Blanchot, Levinas, and Derrida all object to the totalizing nature of the philosophy of history which, as they see it, has dominated moern thought.  Each criticizes or replaces it with a philosophy of language  translation, writing, dialogue  in which theorizing arises from the relation of same and other.  We examine their ideas about history and language and look at their literary styles as expressions of their philosophies;  in addition we read some illustrative literature.

(PRT)|#|RLST150  AF|^|Eye of God: Race and Empire|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|In mythic cycles from the "Western Tradition," there has been a sustained intrigue over the relationship between the human eye and the heavenly sun. From the Cyclops of Homer's Odyssey to its refiguring in D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation," the powers of the eye are equated with those of its celestial counterpart. This intrigue has been reshapedbut not lostwith the advent of modern visual surveillance techniques. In this course, we will examine a range of manifestations of the solar eye, paying particular attention to the relationship(s) it bears to reality and the ways in which the solar eye operates in schemes both great and small of confidence and illusion. We will consider works by Plato, Foucault, Ellison and Morrison; documents in government policy; and movies like "The Fly," "Cube," "9" and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. (PRT). Letter grade only.|#|RLST152  PO|^|Children's Literature|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Many childrens stories describe a passage from immaturity to individuality and responsibility and facilitate such a passage in their readers. We study this pattern in various works with a focus on the role of ritual and magic. Our purpose is to arrive at a critical awareness of how the stories work and to speculate on the residue they leave on our religious sense and hermeneutics. |#|RLST157  PO|^|Post-Holocaust Philosophy|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|According to some thinkers, the event of the Holocaust has called into question all Western thought that preceded it. We examine this claim, focusing on the question of whether, after the Holocaust and similar contemporary horrors, theology and philosophy must change in order to speak responsibly. Thinkers taken up include Arendt, Fackenheim, Browning, Bauman, Spiegelman, Voegelin, Adorno, Jabes and Levinas. (PRT)|#|RLST158  PO|^|Jewish Mysticism|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Jewish Mysticism.

We begin with early modern attempts to define Judaism as against secular society, and follow this concern as it evolves into contemporary theory about the role of dialogue with the other in the formation of the individual.  We read Spinoza, Mendelssoh, Rosenzweig, Buber, and Levinas. |#|RLST164  PO|^|Women in Islamic Traditions|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Engendering and Experience: Women in Islamic Traditions.

In this course, students will combine community engagement work with their class work; learning about diverse thinkers and reformers, who have either found religious meaning in their activist or service work, or who have interpreted philosophy, doctrine, theology, or liturgy as demanding action from them.  Each semester, readings will be grouped around a particular theme such as: Engaged Buddhism; interfaith activism; violent vs. non-violent protest; the Direct Action years of the Civil Rights Movement; education as activism; theological and philosophical theories of justice; socialisms and social change; queer and Christian communities; and Hindu environmentalism. The class will meet once a week, every other week.

This course examines the complicated intersections of gender and religion. Neither gender, nor religion are straightforward categories, as the literatures on each attests and must be theorized as categories with particular histories and cultural contexts. This course will look at the ways in which "gender" and "religion" interact with various historical and cultural contexts to reinforce, contradict and also resist traditional notions of gender and religious experience. Attention will be paid to how religion affects experiences of gender; and how gender affects experiences of religion. More specifically, we will explore the way in which the intersection of gender and religion affects understandings, experiences and negotiations of religious origins, personal identities, religious experiences, agency, body shapes, images and disciplines, sexuality, race relations, cultural appropriations and power structures. (CWS)|#|RLST179G HM|^|Rel Views:Ecology & Climate Chng|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|As the realities of climate change become more apparent and anxieties about the future of humanity rise, many religious leaders and laypeople have taken clear positions on how (or whether) people of faith should respond. They have offered interpretations of scripture or doctrines from within their own traditions hoping to ease people's worries or inspire action. This course looks at how religious individuals draw on the teachings of their faith to understand what nature is, how humans can affect it (or not), and what their responsibilities are to the earth. It also looks at those who believe their religion discourages intervention into natural systems or combatting climate change.  |#|RLST181  PO|^|Prison Punishment Redemption(CP)|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore ideologies of punishment and redemption in relation to the prison industrial complex. We will critique and redefine themes of redemption, correction, debt, virtue, shame, guilt, purity, atonement, damnation, hell and conversion as they influence, infuse and complicate popular understanding of prison, policy development and lived experience of prison. We will be analyzing religious teaching, literature, media, pop culture, policy, political discourse and art. The approach taken will be interdisciplinary with intersectional analysis that includes race, gender, sexuality, ability, class, age, mobility, literacy, education, nationality. This course has six visits to California Institute for Women (prison). Letter grade only. Previously offered as GWS 181  PO.|#|RLST189A PO|^|Contemporary Christian Theology|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|In this close reading of several Christian Theologians, each offering a different perspective, we will ask: How do they reimagine their faith as they respond to racism, misogyny, ethnic cleansing, and violence of all kinds? What is the role of the narrative and moral imagination in their interpretations of Biblical texts and traditional beliefs? Can we, whether Christian or not, find in their theologies strategies for developing our personal worldviews and our responses to the challenges we face in today's worlds?|#|RLST189D PO|^|Religion and Politics|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Separating religion and politics is a hallmark of modernity. Yet what counts as "religion" or "politics" continues to be a point of conflict. Does politics imitate or even rival divine sovereignty? Is politics possible precisely because it is distinct from divine sovereignty? Does (and should) separation protect religion from politics or politics from religion? What do terms like "faith-based," "free exercise," "establishment," or "toleration" mean? Do religious discourses like prophesy or love of neighbor function as socio-political critiques or do they, instead, depoliticize injustice? We examine how these questions show up in Western thought, through theological works, political theory, court cases, current events, and debates on secularism. While focusing on Christianity and its legacy, we also examine the effects ofthese issues on Judaism and Islam in their confrontations with Christianity, on the one hand, and the rise of the "secular" nation-state, on the other.|#|RLST189L PO|^|Encountering the Qur'an|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course explores the significance of the Qur'an as both a scriptural text and a source of cultural and religious expression. Students will gain an understanding of the Qur'an as a source of religious law, as inspiration for artistic expression, as a form of auditory experience, and other various ways in which the Qur'an is situated within Islamic practice and culture. Students will engage with interpretations of the Qur'an and other scholarly work on the text, and with produce their own guide to understanding the Qur'an.|#|RLST190  PO|^|Senior Seminar|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Required for all senior majors.

focuses on media representations of college student life, linking these to sociological
concepts and methods. We will examine how college students (and to a lesser extent
graduate students and faculty) are portrayed in movies, documentary films, and in
television series. Key sociological concepts will be discussed and used to analyze how
major media portrays ?the college experience?, and what similarities and differences
there are between how research conceptualizes the college experience and what

The course will examine human societies and their relationships to nature, with an underlying
focus on the societal causes and implications of climate change. While using a sociological lens,
the course will draw on an interdisciplinary mix of materials to explore different societies and
historical and contemporary relationships to the non-human world. In particular, differences
between Euro-American relations structured by capitalism and diverse North American
Indigenous practices shaped by traditional Indigenous knowledge will be featured. In the context
of current and emergent policies, students will imagine transitions to various possible climate
futures, from a decarbonized extension of the present to degrowth transformations to catastrophic
escapism and ecofascism. We will identify possibilities of, processes for, and challenges facing
the restructuring of society towards sustainable--and specifically post-carbon--futures. In
conjunction with the above material, students will be asked to be attentive to their own
relationship with the natural world and to the reality of climate change. I will strive to make the
class a site of mutual support for conscious efforts of self-care in the context of ongoing climate
change.|#|SOC 072  PZ|^|Hidden: US & Soviet Colonialism|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|Hidden in Plain Sight: U.S. and Soviet Colonialism

many social scientists, both the United States and the Soviet Union can readily be understood and
analyzed as versions of colonialism and/or empire. The course will highlight similarities and
differences between the two cases regarding a number of specific dimensions of colonial and
imperial social relations. Readings and sources will include perspectives from Ukraine, Kazahkstan,

Wokeness is a term created by African Americans and often used as a hashtag in piecemeal ways by
mainstream society. In this course, we will challenge the idea of what wokeness means, its early derivatives, and its true definition by examining mostly early 20th century to more contemporary African American contributors to sociology such as St. Clair Drake,
Dorothy Roberts, bell hooks, Tressie McMillan-Cottom, and Whitney Laster-Pirtle. Much of
African-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being "woke" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding. |#|SOC 110  PZ|^|Classical Sociological Theory|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines some of the most important and influential thinkers who helped create and shape the discipline of sociology: Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Gilman, etc. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate school.|#|SOC 114  CH|^|LA Communities:Trans/Ineq/Actvsm|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Los Angeles Communities: Use of case study approach to explore the interplay between economic and demographic transformations and community dynamics.

By examining various works and debates by scholars and writers (including journalists and activists) who speak of their experiences as well as those who study gender's impact on society, we will wrestle with and think critically about gender and how social constructs such as respectability politics, gendered expectation within workplaces, racism, transphobia, and heterosexism influence and counter gender expressions.

Prerequisite: 44. |#|SPAN132  PZ|^|The Silenced Voices of Tango|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|The Silenced Voices of Tango - Las voces silenciadas del tango rioplatense

This course will examine an alternative historical perspective of the history of Tango, a
cultural practice of Uruguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina from 1880 until today. We will
put special attention to the agents without a voice, in particular people of color and
gender minorities. We will explore the work of musicians, poets, singers and dancers
who played a crucial role and were consistently erased in the history of tango (for
instance Rosendo Mendizabal, Paquita Bernard, and members of the Tango Queer
Movement).
The class will include sources drawn from social sciences, journalism, testimony, film and
literature, and will have a Seminar format.|#|SPAN133  SC|^|Translation & Right to Language|^|SHSP|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|133. Translations of Latin America and the "Right to Language."
Is translation an impossible task? This course will first examine key theories of translation (Schopenhauer, Von Humboldt, Nietzche, Benjamin, Pax, Ortega y Gasset, Borges, Derrida) to help us think about the issues that surround the practice of translation. The second phase of the course will allow us to translate from Spanish into English parts of key literary texts by Asturias, Cabrera Infante, Valenzuela at the same time we compare our work to that of their "official" translations by translators such as Rabassa and Levine. Finally, we shall explore translation as a practice that often contributes to a history of inequality among languages and people from different ethnic backgrounds. Prerequisite: Spanish 101. M. Perez de Mendiola.
|#|SPAN134  SC|^|Indig Women, Represent, & Strug|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|Throughout this current post-colonial era, we have witnessed emergent indigenous initiatives that have sought to challengedominant social, economic and gender structures in Latin America. Among the rangeof approaches that study these initiatives, the field ofâindigenous feminismâhas remained an era of contention among indigenous and non-indigenous scholars as well as activists. The course will focus on how current emancipatory thought and practice led by indigenous women has challenged that the ethnocentric andhomogenizing assumptions embedded in certain critical perspectives and feminist traditions. This course will explore a broad range of interdisciplinary theories and studies (across the social sciences and humanities)as well as literary and cinematic representations that have shaped leadership and cultural analysis for indigenous women in Latin America, specifically Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Guatemala. Along with representation of indigenous peoples by non-indigenous critics or authors, we will also study initiatives of self-representations in testimonio and films in order to analyze how the use of different media hasbecome a key factor for conveying memories of struggle and for the ongoing reformulation of past legacies in the context of the neoliberal era. |#|SPAN135  PO|^|The Boom:Modern Latin Amer Novel|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Analyzes the coming of age of Latin American fiction and its debut on the international stage, addressing theoretical, political and cultural issues. Including Borges, Cortázar, Cabrera Infante, García Márquez, Fuentes, Donoso and Puig, among others. Prerequisites: SPAN 101 PO. |#|SPAN136  PZ|^|Caribbean Popular Culture|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course will focus on analyzing Caribbean popular culture (mainly from the Spanish-Speaking
Caribbean) from a chronological perspective in order to consider how critical terms that inform the
critical analyses of literary, musical and performance cultures in the Caribbean region are shifting.
We will map these shifts from the working-class musical genres which acquired a national recognition
after been considered for decades as inferior culture. We will consider how the urban setting redefined the new Black subculture of drugs and marginality. The course will link reggaeton/raggadancehall with activism, and generally we will consider the issues of citizenship/ migration, and sexuality. |#|SPAN137  SC|^|Translating the Aztecs|^|SHSP|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|This course considers the translation of Aztec (Nahua) culture across time and mediums such as pictographic books, alphabetic writing, theatrical performance, and film. The moment of conquest will serve as a pivot as we trace a genealogy of indigenous cultural expression through these varied mediums from pre-Columbian times to the present, paying particular attention to alphabetized Nahuatl as a colonial tool of domination that complicates standard ideas of literacy. Against these ideas, students will explore, through artistic projects, alternatives to logocentric "literature." Coursework includes introductory Nahuatl lessons, paleography using archival documents, and translation workshops. |#|SPAN139  SC|^|Plants, Culture, Magic|^|SHSP|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|In this course, we will learn about the diverse uses of plants in Latin America. Our inspiration will come from the practical and magical things that Indigenous and Afro-descended communities have done with plants to make them an integral part of their cultural practices. With a seminar/workshop format, most class sessions will involve the creation of something tangible (like salves, incense, or pigments), allowing us to learn by doing. |#|SPAN140  PO|^|From Borges to "Literatura Lite"|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Describes and interrogates two moments in Latin American literary and cultural history, from Borges to the as yet under-theorized "present."

Prerequisite: SPAN 101 PO. |#|SPAN144  PZ|^|Environ Issues in Latin America|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|COURSE TITLE: "Exploitation, Extraction, and Hope: Environmental Issues in Latin America"
From the first colonial contact through to today, Latin America's wealth of natural resources has been
matched only by the global desire to extract and exploit those resources, with profound effects upon
peoples and communities throughout the region. The social, political, and cultural debates surrounding
Latin Americas relationship to western modernity are awash with representations of and reflections upon
the connection between humans, corporations, nations, and nature. Through diverse media including
chronicles, memoirs, novels, poetry, reports, and both fictional and documentary films, we will explore
issues like extractivism, development, modernization, and activism. Taught in Spanish|#|SPAN146  PO|^|Latin Amer/Latin@ Poetry|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Readings in Latin American and U.S. Latin@/Chicano@ poetry, from modernismo through the present.

film, journalism, music, and visual arts. Often seen in the headlines for its roles in the drug trade and the soâcalled war on drugs, and 
known for its telenovelas and beauty queens, its worldâfamous footballers and cyclists, and its 
coffee, Colombia has endured the longestârun armed conflict in the western hemisphere. It is a 
complex and diverse nation with strong regional identities, a dire history of partisan political 
violence, and skyrocketing levels of social and economic inequality. But, it also has one of 
the worldâs most progressive constitutions, which, at least on paper, recognizes the 
contributions of indigenous, afrodescendants and other minoritized groups and 
protects their land and their rights. In addition to exploring the historical roots of 
Colombiaâs armed conflict and its interactions with other global events and forces, we will discuss how Colombian cultural production has grappled with issues such 
as the rural and urban divide, developmentalism, race, gender and class relations, urban 
violence, political mobilization, displacement and migration, and extractive industries and 
economies.  The seminar will include opportunities to have discussions with Colombian artists, writers, intellectuals, and students.  Taught in Spanish |#|SPAN152  SC|^|Border Thinking in Spain|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|This class explores border narratives in Spain and Catalonia that articulate the complex needs of cultural and ethnic minorities in multicultural democracies and help chart a way out of oppressive social formations. Transcultural forms of expression such as storytelling, visual arts, film and performance will be analyzed. Prerequisite: SPAN044|#|SPAN153  PO|^|Spanglish in Context|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|What, exactly is "Spanglish," and who has the right to use it? How does this designation serve individuals as both a means of suppression and a practice of resistance? In this course we will investigate Spanish-English bilingualism in the U.S., focusing on empirical data from multiple theoretical perspectives: sociolinguistic, anthropological, political and literary. Prerequisite: SPAN 101 PO.|#|SPAN154  SC|^|Trans-Caribbean Formations|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|This course will explore questions of identity formations and translations during different historical time periods in the Caribbean. We will pay close attention to how conceptualizations of blackness are deployed-simultaneously highlighted and erased-during different iterations of nation-building projects in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. We will also explore the place of indigenous peoples in Caribbean national imaginaries. Our studies of novels, short stories, political essays, films, and other audiovisual materials will allow us to analyze how the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality are "translated" into Caribbean identity formation both nationally and transnationally. Prerequisite: Spanish 44|#|SPAN155  SC|^|Short Fiction by Spanish Women|^|SHSP|^|05.0130|^|SC|^|This course will analyze the narrative techniques peculiar to the genres of the modern novella and short story, while also studying the works in their historical, cultural, and literary contexts. Spanish women writers will include, among others, Emilia Pardo Bazan, Carmen de Burgos, Ana Maria Matute, Carmen Martin Gaite, Cristina Fernandez Cubas. Prerequisite: Spanish 44. 
|#|SPAN159  PO|^|Multilingual Spain|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Language in Spain functions as a source of communal identity and a site of political contestation. Spanish is the official language of the State, and regional languages such as Catalan and Basque are "co-official" in their respective territories. In this course we will investigate the linguistic situation of contemporary Spain, learning a range of concepts from the field of sociolinguistics: language standardization; language maintenance and revitalization; language and identity; language policy and bilingual education; and linguistic discrimination. We will also consider the role that language has played in recent debates about Catalonian independence, the status of immigrants in Spanish society, and the relationships among ethnicity, class, and nationhood. Prerequisites: SPAN101  PO.|#|SPAN163  PZ|^|Afrolatinidades|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the black experience in Latin American history and society from the slavery era to present day. Latin America as a vast geographical space cannot possibly be comprehended in one class; therefore, excerpts from a variety of disciplines will be studied thematically in an effort to encompass a broad, but not diluted, understanding of the issues that have historically faced Afro-descendants in the Latin American continent. It will look specifically at the ways in which Afro-Latino artists have represented blackness and designed their own subjectivities and agencies. |#|SPAN163  PZ|^|Afrolatinidades|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the black experience in Latin American history and society from the slavery era to present day.

Most Basques live in seven historical territories and speak Spanish, French, and Euskara. The aim of this course is to introduce students to Basque culture from a historical, linguistic, anthropological, political and artistic perspective. As one of the most unique regions of Spain, it provides a fertile ground to analyze decentralized forms of knowledge. We will tackle issues such a nation/nation state, ethnicity and identity politics; sexualities and gender, tradition and modernity. The course will also examine Basques in the American diaspora.

Film, videos, and interactive readings will bring the texts to life! Prerequisite: Spanish 44.|#|SPAN181  SC|^|Indigenous Filmmaking Abiayala|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|From Indigenous Filmic Portrayals to Indigenous Filmmaking in the Abiayala. This course examines the history of Indigenous representations and self-representation
through film, spanning from the mid-20th century through to the current date in the Abiayala (term in Gunna language to refer to Latin America). The course will consider different modes of production (e.g., industrial, independent, community-based, educational), genres (with special emphasis on documentary), and audiences (international, national, or local).

In this course, we study several series of the region by exploring its "poetics" (the formal elements that distinguish the series from other forms of visual storytelling) and its "politics" (the most relevant social and cultural themes for this specific format). We will also read scholarly works that analyze these series. The course, which deals with various social, political, and cultural issues, poses the following question "What these series are telling us about contemporary Latin American societies?"  Prerequisite: One prior course in SPAN (100 level).|#|SPAN184  SC|^|The Image and the Word|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|The relation between writing, painting, photography and cinema might at first be viewed as a simple and familiar combination of visual and verbal art as felicitous interplay based on affinity and compatability.  However, it also generates numerous theoretical speculations with far-reaching implications for the theorization of art and literature.  The potentially frictional relations between the visual image and the written text are especially pertinent for a discussion of the artworks of many Latin American and Spanish artists and writers.

Why should disability justice be central to feminist thought? How do writings by feminists of color broaden our understanding of the body, illness, and health? This writing-intensive seminar approaches disability studies as both a critical methodology and a political practice, paying close attention to the role of writing and the arts in world-making. As a Disability Justice Collective, we will use our writing to surface ableist logics, challenge dominant narratives, and envision liberatory alternatives.|#|WRIT100A PZ|^|Writing Center Theory & Praxis|^|ZWRI|^||^|PZ|^|"Good writers are born, not made" - so the common misconception goes. Yet research shows us writing is a social practice developed through regular practice, challenging new tasks, and constructive feedback. In this seminar we investigate theories from writing studies to examine our own diverse experiences in writing. What does it mean to call something "good" writing? What ideological and cultural assumptions underwrite definitions? What can scholars tell us about why so many of us struggle with the writing process? And what are some strategies we can use to help ourselves and others grow as writers? Aimed at students interested in cultivating the habits of effective writers, educators, this class is both theoretical and practical in its orientation.|#|WRIT100B PZ|^|Writing Center Theory & Praxis|^|ZWRI|^||^|PZ|^|"Good writers are born, not made" - so the common misconception goes.

What does multilingualism mean and look like? How does the ability to communicate in multiple languages shape and enrich one's writing? This seminar will apply the many different theoretical frameworks that define multilingualism and examine our own diverse experiences with writing and translanguaging. This course seeks to analyze how language, culture, class, and identity affect our ways of communicating through speaking and writing, and apply strategies to help us make choices that build on our strengths and enhance our communication skills.|#|WRIT105  SC|^|Writing and the Liberal Arts|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|We'll investigate the rhetoric of arguments regarding current challenges for the liberal-arts curriculum, asking questions such as: What are the traditional liberal arts, and how are they being re-defined today in response to larger shifts in the culture? Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values
threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions. Assignments will likely include debates or mock trials on our main questions, analytical responses to the readings, workshops and reviews of classmates compositions, a mission statement for a liberal-arts college, and a defense or critique of a requirement at the Claremont colleges.|#|WRIT109  SC|^|Writing Studio|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this writing workshop, students develop their understanding of the academic writing process, including prompts and disciplinary conventions; invention, brainstorming, and prewriting; drafting, revision, and editing; peer response; critical thinking; research; and oral presentation. Students discuss academic genres and writing conventions as well as rhetorical framing and audience expectations of individual essays of any kind (including senior thesis chapters), which they workshop as a group. Course may be taken twice for credit.|#|WRIT110  SC|^|Introduction to Rhetoric|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course combines canonical theories and contemporary practices of rhetoric.  We will study representative texts on the arts and techniques of persuasion from the classical, renaissance, and modern periods.  We will apply their ideas to current cases in politics and the media.  Assignments will include rhetorical analyses and creative arguments (advertisements, formal letters, propaganda,manifestos, policy briefs).|#|WRIT113  SC|^|Prose Style & the Sentence|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This is a course about sentences. We will study how to appreciate and analyze them; how to expand and contract them; how to translate them from one register/style to another; and how to move their words around for rhetorical effect. We will read from a few style handbooks (with exercises), scrutinize sentences from a wide range of sources, imitate some major stylists, compose a couple of short papers, and even try our hand at diagramming sentences, as well as complete a course project. Mostly, though, we will take a workshop approach to crafting a wide range of sentences in which every word tells.  |#|WRIT119  SC|^|A Geneology of Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|A cross-cultural and interdisciplinary history, this course will investigate what writing does for humanbeings: as a species, as a community, and as individuals. We?ll begin with the economic and cultural  origins  of  writing.  Our  case  study  will  be  the  evolution  of  Chinese  graphs,  the invention  of printing in China, and its spread westward. We?ll then examine studies of the early modern printing press in Europe, the growth of literacy, and its consequences for the period?s colonial  encounters  between literate  and  non-literate  societies. Next, we?ll explore  modern writing  technologies  such  as pencils  and computers.  We?ll conclude  by  reading  contemporary findings  on  the  relation  between  writing  and cognitive development, including education and psychological healing.|#|WRIT122  SC|^|Proposal and Application Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course will simultaneously provide the theoretical background of application essays as a genre of writing, with its own expectations and values, and share specific strategies and techniques to help students research, draft, and revise their application essays. As students work on their essays, and workshop them in class, they will reflect on the types of writing they are most familiar with and reflect on the ways that application essays differ from and align with other types of argument-driven writing. At the end of the term, students will submit final essays for their chosen opportunity, whether a fellowship or graduate school, and compose written reflections on their research and writing processes, to help prepare them for future writing regardless of genre.|#|WRIT122  SC|^|Proposal and Application Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course will simultaneously provide the theoretical background of application essays as a genre of writing, with its own expectations and values, and share specific strategies and techniques to help students research, draft, and revise their application essays.

Literary  Journalism  has  beengrouped  in  or  alongside  categories  such  as "The  New Journalism," "Gonzo Journalism," "Muckraking," "Public Access," "Underground," "Advocacy," and "Stunt" or "Immersion  Journalism."  It has also been  viewed as an ethical conundrum, a violation of journalism's most sacred tenets, because it foregrounds the journalist's experience and uses storytelling techniques  associated  with  fiction  writing.  Does  the  "literary"  nature  of  this  genre  of  journalism  destroy "objectivity" and hinder the search for "truth"? or does it allow for a more immersive access into "truth?" We will pursue this question by reading the historical antecedents of literary journalism beginning in the eighteenth century  and  discuss  its  practitioners  through  to  the  present  day,  spending  time  on the genre's social justice tendencies and its gradual entry into mainstream journalism in the early-and mid-twentieth century.  Students  will  practice  various  approaches  to this subgenre  and  work  to  put  together  a  Literary Journalism publication by the end of the semester.  This section of this course is not taught as an Inside-Out course. Students interested in the Inside-Out course will enroll in WRIT130IOSC if offered.|#|WRIT130IOSC|^|Literary Journalism|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This  workshop-based  course  focuses  on Literary  Journalism,  a  subgenre  of  Creative Nonfiction.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.|#|WRIT132  SC|^|Arts + Culture Review|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is a writing workshop designed to enhance your skills in the journalistic review. Focusing on reviews of food, travel, books, film, music, and art and performance, we'll read reviews from the best practitioners in each area as well as cultural theories of taste and aesthetics and discuss the politics of both. We'll develop our critical palates by doing tast tests and short critiques in class. Finally, we'll talk about the ethics and logistics of reviewing as well as issues of form. Assignments will include reviews in each area and critical responses to the reviews of others. |#|WRIT135  SC|^|Writing Social Media|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This is a course in which students study and produce writing in social media genres, while also practicing argumentative, analytical, and research writing transferable to academia.

This is a workshop-based course designed to enhance students' skills in crafting arguments about contemporary political and ethical problems and to develop their awareness of language's possibilities. We will examine the editorial as the most economical and condensed example of argumentative writing that exploits the full range of rhetorical techniques. We will read editorials on a variety of topics (some chosen by the class). For these readings, our main task will be to scrutinize each argument's logic and its author's strategies to gain credibility. Assignments will include exercises on logic and logical flaws, imitations of prose styles, and a portfolio of editorials. |#|WRIT139  SC|^|Election Lab|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Election Lab: Rhetoric, Commentary, and Podcasts
A writing class focused on the rhetoric of the current election. We'll investigate how the language of candidates and ballot proposals tries to persuade us. Our primary texts will likely include the Voter Information Guide, political ads, debates, and speeches.  We'll also consider commentary from leading political podcasts, some chosen by the students. And we'll study a few canonical writers on rhetoric and politics such as Raymond Williams, George Orwell, and George Lakoff.|#|WRIT145  SC|^|Women's Memoir/Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course proposes to examine the revolutionary aspects of the memoir through women's memoirs of varied backgrounds and proposes to engage students in the political and healing journey of writing their own life stories through nonfiction essays and blurred genres. Themes addressed will include: childhood, violence, survival, memory, death, race, spirituality, generational difference, sexuality, class, and migration. Students should expect to take part in weekly discussions on assigned readings as well as to workshop writings generated in and out of class by their peers. Text may include literature by the following: Patti Smith, Sandra Cisneros, Dorothy Allison Eula Biss, and Miriam Toews.  For the Fall 2019 class, Miriam Toews is confirmed to hold a private class session with members of the course during her visit to campus November 12 with Scripps Presents/HBA Lecture funds. |#|WRIT153IOSC|^|Introduction to Podcasting|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, to ground us in the foundations of today?s rapid rise in audiobooks and podcasts, we begin with tradition of oral storytelling in ancient Greece and in African and African?American traditions. We will then examine a range of approaches to podcasting and the ways in which these approaches connect with and disrupt other forms of argument?driven writing. Students will select a podcast and analyze the way it presents and tells a story about a specific topic, considering both the text and accompanying audio content and sounds. Students will then create and deliver their own podcast episode.

|#|WRIT155  SC|^|Writing Satire|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Workshop-based exploration of the fun, purposes, values, and mechanics of contemporary satire. The main question for our readings and compositions will be: how does satire persuade? To guide our practice, we'll focus on the satirical coverage of the current US Presidential election by late-night tv hosts, stand-up comics, political cartoonists, The Onion, MacSweeney's, the Harvard Lampoon, and Claremont's Golden Antlers. Assignments will alternate between writing satires and analyses of satires.
|#|WRIT160  SC|^|Theories & Pedagogies of Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is an advanced introduction to composition studies. Well examine influential essays from our discipline, mostly theory and case studies on teaching writing. In addition, well observe and conduct mock tutorial sessions, practice responses to student writing, and present and discuss examples of particularly good or bad instructional sessions.|#|WRIT169AOSC|^|Classroom-based Tutoring|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, we discuss the theory and practice of a range of pedagogical practices that have been called writing fellows/mentors,embedded tutoring,classroom-based tutoring,curriculum-based tutoring,and subject-area specialist tutoring. In contrast to generalist tutoring that takes place in a writing center or otherwise outside of a classroom, with a tutor who works from a position of unfamiliarity with the subject matter of the essays they tutor, this kind of tutoring presumes specialization and familiarity. It also presumes a working relationship with the faculty member whose students are being tutored and allows group tutoring and workshops in the classroom. We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.
